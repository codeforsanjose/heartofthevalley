The deed to the City specified that the City “will make said park a place of relaxation, recreation, and enjoyment for the people of the City of San José, and in such a manner as will, to extent that such can be reasonably done, give to said park a rural county character and atmosphere.” <br/><br/> Emma Prusch Farm Park includes heritage, high density, and rare fruit orchards, a Plant Science Center, two community gardens, pollinator and butterfly gardens, as well as acres of lush green lawns for picnics and playing. It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine. <br/><br/> In 2006, Gloria Bornstein was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San José's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. <br/><br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-A-Monument-to-the-Last-Barn-E-442",

The artwork is part of the Alum Rock Cultural History Corridor (ARCHC), which seeks to celebrate the rich cultural history of east San José through artworks and other elements. <br/><br/>Raps’ sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved ‘tines’ that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. <br/><br/>The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow’s curved 'tines', miming the harrow’s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community. The arms in the artwork are castings of real community members, underscoring the artwork’s connection to the area and to this community (see fact sheet for detail). Each person has a real connection to the idea represented in the work. <br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Cultivating-Community-Tropica-458",

      "description": "In 2006, Larry Kirkland created these sculptures. Located in the viewing garden that spans the northeast facade of the Evergreen Branch Library, Larry Kirkland’s sculpture speaks of the human potential for learning and exploration through our senses. According to the artist: <br/> “What unites all people is our search to understand our world and existence. From the moment we are born we begin the process of discovery that continues throughout our lives.  For that reason I have decided to title the sculptures Discoveries.” <br/><br/> The concept of the pieces was to suggest the universal human potential for exploration and learning through our senses.The three large white marble stones were found in Carrara, Italy in the same place where Michelangelo sourced stone for his carvings over 500 years ago. The carving of the stones into an ear, mouth, and eye, show the human forms emerging out of the rough hewn boulders. It is a balance of the beauty of the natural stone and the beautiful carving of the human forms. <br/><br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Soaring-Flight-Evergreen-Park-441",

      "description": "Addressing the mid-century agricultural labor history in East San José, the artist worked with the project architects to design the shape of the rotunda, the columns, the terrazzo flooring and window openings at the Hillview Library. Each of the eight free-standing structural columns is composed of a stack of tractor tires; curved staves milled from recycled old-growth redwood, which are evocative of a harvest basket; the stainless steel can that pays homage to the canneries; and madrone branches, an indigenous tree revered by the local Ohlone Native Americans. <br/><br/>Trachtenberg was also captivated by the intrinsic beauty of the farmed landscape, inspiration which she captured and reflected in the other component of Groundwork: a series of twenty-six paintings called The Shadow Frieze. The paintings that encircle the rotunda below the window openings evoke the aerial views of tilled earth, orchards, and crop rows. <br/><br/> These were created in 2007. <br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Groundwork-and-The-Shadow-Fri-478",

      "description": "In 2010, Kipp Kobayashi and Marta Perlas created these iconic columns for the entrance to Fire Station 19. The concept for the columns was influenced by the multi-functional role each firefighter plays on the team. Also it was influenced by the community and its diversity, as well as how the community relates to and perceives the firefighters (and vice versa). <br/><br/>The 8’ tall columns bases are articulated like the equipment fittings found on the rigs and hydrants. On the stainless steel columns are etched images of firefighters and historic firefighters from cultures from throughout history: 1) Wildland firefighter, 2) Explorers (youth firefighter program), 3) Vigiles Urbani (the first organized fire brigade of Europe), 4) Knight of Malta (where the current Maltese cross on firefighters emblem originated), 5) Edo Firefighter (early Japanese firefighter) and 6) Sapeurs-Pompiers (the first professional firefighters from the French Army of the 19th century). <br/><br/>Each column is divided into three parts that can be turned individually, like a section of a mix ‘n match puzzle so that the figures can be morphed into any number of combinations.<br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Guardians-of-the-Garden-City--436",

      "description": "One July Saturday in 2005, a San Jose resident took a walk with his dog along the Guadalupe River, just north of the San Jose International Airport. He recognized that the objects poking out of the ground that day were clearly unusual -- he had discovered the tusks and skeleton of a mammoth.<br/><br/> <em>Lupe the Mammoth</em> was inspired by this discovery. <br/>The artwork is a technology-driven design with hand-crafted sensibilities. While the actual mammoth was a juvenile and about 8’ tall, the sculpture measures 12.5’ in height and is made of galvanized steel. The artwork was painstakingly fabricated at Paramount Roll & Forming; bent piece by piece and fit into a notched support structure after which it was galvanized for its final finish. <br/><br/> The artwork is titled “Lupe,” but has quickly assumed the nickname Lupe the Mammoth as a popular post on social media; #LupeTheMammoth. <br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Lupe-the-Mammoth-Guadalupe-Tr-559",

All the elements are based on objects, images and ideas cultivated by the artists from the community. <br/><br/> The artists engaged in extensive interaction with the Edenvale community in the creation of the artwork. They went out to schools, neighborhood and community gatherings, youth centers and the library to encourage community members to <em>Be a Part of the Art</em> by contributing objects, stories, photos and memorabilia that represented their own lives. <br/><br/> This work was created in 2010; it is located at the Edenvale Community Center.

It captures the spirit of the path meant to highlight the passage of the seasons and give homage to the site’s agricultural past. <br/> The Path of Ten Thousand Leaves meanders through the 32-acre park with a large circular seating area at the center of the path. <br/><br/>The 1800 foot path is embossed with black walnut and apricrot leaves, thus making the emphemereal process of leaves falling permanent. The embossed leaves also have a fossil-like design nostalgic of the fruit orchards that used to inhabit the site. <br/><br/>Community participation was an integral part of the design of this project. <br/><br/> The project was created in 1999.

The artwork consists of two elements: a vertical 30’ sculptural representation of a glider wing formed of tubular steel and covered in steel mesh, and the colored concrete plaza textured with linear patterns that flow around the wing element in an airflow pattern similar to that around an ascending plane wing. Soaring Flight is positioned with Montgomery Hill as a backdrop, the site of many of his pioneering flights. <br/>Phrases and quotes associated with Montgomery’s work are sandblasted into the plaza; benches are placed around the perimeter of the plaza. Together these elements create, in Roberts’ words, <br/> “A haven where visitors may learn about local history and Montgomery specifically, as well as reflect upon human invention...a subject so significantly linked to San Jose.” <br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Discoveries-Evergreen-Branch--476",

      "description": "Voxel Cloud is visible to thousands of commuters, residents and visitors driving on Interstate 280, as well as aircraft utilizing Mineta San José International Airport.  Draping across the roof line of The Pierce, a residential apartment building in Downtown San Jose, Voxel Cloud serves as a gateway marker for San José’s SoFA Art District, The dynamic, illuminated, data-driven LED sculpture takes its visual cues from natural forms as varied as water particles, interstellar star systems, the crystalline aggregates of silicon carbide, and the multi-chromatic raw materials of semiconductor wafers. <br/><br/> Voxel Cloud was made possible through a partnership between the project owner/developer, Sares Regis Group of Northern California, Pritzker Realty Group, and the City of San José Public Art Program. It was supported in part by an ArtPlace grant (www.artplaceamerica.org). It is the fifth of six Illuminating Downtown Project (IDP) grants awarded for creative placemaking projects in San José, bringing artists and arts organizations together to enrich the city and its communities. IDP combines art and technology to physically manifest San José’s aspiration for creating a more engaging downtown—whether someone is approaching from the surrounding freeways or walking its streets. It was built in 2017.<br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Voxel-Cloud-Pierce-Building-562",
