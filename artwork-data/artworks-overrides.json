      "description": "The 12 sculptures reflect the wildlife of the river. One of the repeated elements in the series, the dragonfly, is considered to be one of the most ancient species that survived from the Jurassic period. The dragonfly references the element of water, as well as the health of the river and its ecological systems. The sculptural insects are of various sizes, heights and locations attached to posts on ball bearings that allow the sculptures to move with the wind. Sunlight creates additional interest by casting shadows through the laser cut wings and reflections off the colorful glass eyes.  The sculptures are intended to reawaken the relationship to the wind, sun, and water, fundamental elements of nature in this urban park. The sculptures also celebrate the Guadalupe River that gives life to flora and fauna and people of San Jose.",

      "description": "This statue of Captain Thomas Fallon was commissioned in 1988.  It memorializes the raising of the U.S. flag in San Jose in 1846, when California was still a part of Mexico.  Scheduled to be installed in 1990, the statue generated an intense controversy.  Supporters of the artwork believed that it commemorated an important historical event in San Jose's history.  Opponents of the statue responded that it represented a troubling moment in American history, when the United States used the Mexican -American War as a reason to annex California from Mexico. To address the issues arising from the controversy, the City appointed a Historic Art Advisory Committee.     The committee recommended that the City's public art must represent all perspectives of the City's history.  Four additional projects were recommended - artworks commemorating the Ohlone Way of Life, the life of Dr. Ernesto Galarza, the Founding of the Pueblo, and the Agricultural History of the Valley.  These works have been installed in various locations around the city.  This artwork is a reminder that a community's historic events can be interpreted in many ways, depending upon one's perspective.",

      "description": "Anna Valentina Murch’s Garden Park is situated in Edenvale Park next to the historic Hayes Mansion. Through public meetings, Murch discovered that the community wanted an artwork that was inspired by the vast history of the site. They asked for the piece to incorporate elements of the indigenous people of the valley, the agricultural era, Frontier Village - the 1960s era amusement park located on the site, the Hayes family orchards, and the garden of Mary Hayes. They also desired an artwork that revolved around a theme of transition, both physically and symbolically, to represent the transformation of the park through the master plan and the restoration of wildlife. Lastly, they hoped that Murch’s artwork would be a place of contemplation and peace. Murch’s artwork features a stone circle in the middle of the garden covered in round holes, reminiscent of Native American pounding holes, which function as waterholes for wildlife. To the north of the stone circle is an oak grove, which also references indigenous people who were dependent upon acorns as a staple of their diet. Ornamental cherry trees are planted to the west and east of the circle in remembrance of the Hayes’s orchard and the valley’s agricultural past. A bridge leads away from the circle towards the mansion over a moat of wildflowers in honor of Frontier Village. Lavender is found on the far edge of the oak grove, creating a rich scent nostalgic of Mary Hayes’ healing garden. This peaceful artwork provides an area for quiet meditation on the transition of the seasons and the transformation of the park’s historic value. Students from neighboring elementary, middle and high schools participated in the creation of the artwork and, in the past, used it as a touchstone for a curriculum about the community.",

      "description": "The main theme of the artwork is Cemanahuac: the location of the individual within his/her community as well as within the cosmos. According to Mesoamerican indigenous cultures and oral traditions, each of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) corresponds to an element, a community memory of value, a time of day, and a color of corn  a fundamental agricultural symbol:    East is fire, family, sunrise, and red corn  West is wind, local heroes, sunset, and yellow corn  South is earth, work, noon, and blue corn  North is water, history, night, and white corn.  These symbols honor the Mexican community in various forms throughout the plaza: Four patterned metal grilles in the windows of the tower introduce traditional ironwork with pre-Columbian designs.  Metal work is continued in each of the gates into the plaza.  Mosaic thresholds inside the gates explore the theme of location and direction. The thresholds were inspired by mosaics commonly seen in Mexican colonial cities such as Taxco, Puebla and Tlaxcala and mosaic work in San Jose.    The garden alcoves are offering places linked by thematic press tiles to the cardinal directions and dedicated to a community value. The tiles were created by community members during a series of public workshops. The photographic tiles were translated from family albums and personal collections contributed by the local community.    A recurring image of the hummingbird, derived from Mesoamerican motifs, can be seen at the water fountain and on two accent walls at the south and east entrances. The hummingbird, an ancient Mesoamerican talisman, is a symbol of love and the warrior spirit. It is common in San Jose, a tiny but tenacious bird that migrates thousands of miles from Mexico to California every year and plays a role in shaping the landscape by pollinating the plants from which it drinks nectar. The hummingbird motif is intended to speak to the spirit of immigrant citizens, their endurance, strength, tenacity, and their contributions to the culture and nature of California. The choices of planting materials in the garden were selected to attract hummingbirds.",

      "description": "Teaching Stones is a tribute to Doris Dillon, a beloved teacher and community member. Doris Dillon was known for her generous spirit and passion for teaching.  She engaged students through games, and it was often said that she could “teach a rock to read.”  Teaching Stones consists of two primary elements. The first is a reading/sitting area, inspired by one of Doris’ favorite activities: story telling. The reading area provides a place to sit and share stories in the traditional manner of gathering in a circle. The decomposed granite interior of the circle extends outward to the sidewalk forming the overall shape of a keyhole, a reflection of Doris’ belief that reading is a key to learning and knowledge, which she shared through teaching.The second element is a series of nine large smooth-surfaced granite stones that are placed throughout the Liquid Amber Tree grove where the project is sited.  Each stone is inscribed with a ribbon containing words from one of the elements of language: nouns, verbs, etc. The words chosen and sandblasted into the stones were collected inspired by Doris Dillon’s life and work. In the same spirit in which Doris fostered learning through play, the stones can serve as a playful learning tool for future generations: rubbings can be done on the stones with pencil and paper, with students moving from stone to stone, gathering a noun from one, a verb from another and onward until a full sentence is collected.This commemorative artwork honors Doris Dillon’s legacy of mixing learning with pleasure in the form of a gift to the community she loved so well.",

      "description": "The movie marquee became a familiar downtown architectural feature with the popularization of cinema in the 1920's and 1930's. Its objective of transmitting information to the street was fully realized at night with illuminated displays as a form of urban seduction.  A contemporary interpretation of the marquee suggests not only technical revision for this transmission of information, but a rethinking of urban communication. Jump Cuts reinterprets the mechanism of the marquee through sculptural, electronic and video elements, broadcasting images and texts, both informational and contemplative, to the street. The artwork transforms the visual accessibility of the lobby by alternating between the actual view from the street and live video views from within, thus flipping the building inside-out and back, electronically.  The project includes twelve 5' by 6'- 8\" liquid-crystal display panels mounted on the outside of the glass facade of the building. By day, viewers see text permanently etched onto the surface of the glass panels.  From the outside, the text reads, \"Truth is stranger than fiction is stranger than truth...\"  From inside the lobby, the text reads, \"Life imitates art imitates life...\" In the evening, the LCD panels  are transformed into video screens.  Images projected onto the screens sequence between movie trailers and live feed from video cameras mounted inside the lobby.  In between these sequences, the screens become transparent, allowing full view of the interior lobby.  A computer controls all of the dynamic elements of the marquee, including activating the panels, turning them translucent and providing the surface upon which images can be projected.  The image sequencing is preprogrammed for the twelve months of the year to begin operation at dusk and continue through midnight.",

      "description": "Fuel Tank brings together a mirror-polished aluminum recycled jet fuel tank and pieces of dichroic glass to create a 20' sculpture that suggests an abstracted flame. The sculpture is highly reflective, both in the sheen of the aluminum and the colored reflection of the dichroic glass. Dichroic glass is highly light sensitive and shifts in color dependent on the angle of viewing and direction of light. Through the day, sunlight interacts with the glass to create moving patterns of colored light across the ground; by night, lit from within, the artwork glows.",

      "description": "The San José Public Art Program in association with project developer Blake Hunt Ventures, commissioned Einar and Jamex de la Torre to collaborate with the community in the creation of artwork for the Story & King Development. The artists created three different artworks, positioned in locations throughout the shopping center parking lot and also on the front and side wall of the Target store. The three distinct works make reference to historic Mexican art forms while integrating the artists' distinct and often humorous take on contemporary culture.  The de la Torre brothers incorporate time-honored styles such as Mexican folk art and  symbols of Catholicism as well as universal subjects such gender roles and cultural integration. As a result, viewers of their work are able to place one foot in the worlds of pre-Columbian Mexico while the other is planted firmly in contemporary society",

The phrase “show your stripes” has long been used to indicate social or political position; show what you’re made of, which side are you on. At one point in history, stripes were relegated to the margins of society: jugglers, courtesans, and in Medieval paintings the devil is often shown wearing stripes. Over time, stripes have taken on a more positive connotation: freedom, playfulness, or with banker’s pinstripes – taste and status. The artwork is not simply a light show. For the changes to be activated, it takes viewer participation, as the activation phone number above indicates. A quiet reflector of the changing sky during the day, at night the piece transforms into San Jose’s shared secret – the phone number a pass code to control the changing patterns. In 2015, launching the first of a series of light-based artworks that will appear throughout downtown San José as part of the “Illuminating Downtown Project,” the artist was invited to develop a new series of interactive programs based on community input. After completing a simple and fun survey, the Mr. Conti choreographed a sequence of unique stripes based on participants’ answers.  Some number sequences relate to a community member’s favorite song or color, others are simply employed for their dynamism or beauty. A menu of over 300 codes is available in the document section above.   Artwork Activation:  Call 408.287.0128After The Tone, Enter any 3 digit combination from 1 - 9 Press “0” (Zero), Then Hang UpNote: Not all combinations are programmed – yet\r\n    \r\n        \r\n             District\r\n             3\r\n        \r\n        \r\n             Report a concern\r\n              (408) 793-04330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n       \r\n    .telerik-reTable-1\r\n    {\r\n    border-width: 0px;\r\n    border-style: none;\r\n    border-collapse: collapse;\r\n    font-family: Tahoma;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 tr.telerik-reTableHeaderRow-1\r\n    {\r\n    margin: 10px;\r\n    padding: 10px;\r\n    color: #3F4D6B;\r\n    background: #D6E8FF;\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    font-style: normal;\r\n    text-transform: capitalize;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    border-spacing: 10px;\r\n    line-height: 14pt;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableHeaderFirstCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    line-height: 14pt;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableHeaderLastCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    line-height: 14pt;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableHeaderOddCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    line-height: 14pt;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableHeaderEvenCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    color: #3a4663;\r\n    line-height: 14pt;\r\n    font-weight: bold;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 tr.telerik-reTableOddRow-1\r\n    {\r\n    color: #666666;\r\n    background-color: #F2F3F4;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 tr.telerik-reTableEvenRow-1\r\n    {\r\n    color: #666666;\r\n    background-color: #E7EBF7;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableFirstCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableLastCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableOddCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding:5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableEvenCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding:5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 tr.telerik-reTableFooterRow-1\r\n    {\r\n    background-color: #D6E8FF;\r\n    color: #4A5A80;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    font-size: 10pt;\r\n    font-family: Tahoma;\r\n    line-height: 11pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableFooterFirstCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    border-top: solid gray 1.0pt;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableFooterLastCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding:5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    border-top: solid gray 1.0pt;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableFooterOddCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    border-top: solid gray 1.0pt;\r\n    }\r\n    .telerik-reTable-1 td.telerik-reTableFooterEvenCol-1\r\n    {\r\n    /*padding: 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt 5.4pt;*/\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n    border-top: solid gray 1.0pt;\r\n    }",

The artist inspired by this and further intrigued by the transformation of butterflies, and that as a metaphor for the human life process from childhood to maturity. With these ideas in mind Ms. Liew created Trees of Knowledge: two \"trees\" formed by integrating painted elements, positioned to suggest treetops, onto columns of the building. Their shape also echoes that of butterfly wings and each is painted with rich, colorful mythological imagery. Ms. Liew suggests that these, \"serve as a gateway to the world of imagination and learning that await the visitors to the Children's section of the library.\"   Ms. Liew's Metamorphosis - Transformation in the Woods is a painting in the form of butterfly wings. Located in the Storytelling Corner, these are positioned so as to frame the storyteller. Colorful imagery on the wings references characters from classic fairytales, nursery rhymes set in the forest, and folklore and is intended to inspire positive themes for young readers.",

The project elements work together to stimulate community curiosity, encourage participation in best household practices, and promote environmental stewardship:Doorhanger:  Addressing the issue directly at the household, a bold graphic poster is distributed as a door hanger by DOT crews in the vicinity of recent sanitary sewer maintenance activity. The poster features simple and engaging icons to educate about various FOG wastes and common household products not to be put in sinks; the poster also brings awareness to features of the infrastructure system. Printed in the project’s signature electric green color, the door hanger connects to the other art elements described below. Multi-lingual text provides explanation and vocabulary for a more informed community. Manhole Marker: Bringing attention to the infrastructure below the streets, manholes of recently serviced sewer lines were painted in the project’s signature electric green color, creating awareness of this largely unnoticed infrastructure. Painting of the manholes coincided with the distribution of door hangers creating a connection from the front door to the system under the street. Maintenance Truck Graphic: A bold vinyl graphic was applied to select sewer maintenance trucks traveling to the target neighborhoods that features a design that calls out the 24/7 sewer maintenance service provided by the City. The vinyl graphic will be rendered in the project’s signature electric green color reinforcing the connection between the truck, door hangers and manhole markers and the workforce that is constantly on the move to manage the system. DistrictCity Wide Report a concern (408) 793-4330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov",

The asymmetrical flowing lines and shapes created by the surface finish references the fork where Coyote Creek overflows into the by-pass channel.

      "description": "One July Saturday in 2005, a San Jose resident took a walk with his dog along the Guadalupe River, just north of the San Jose International Airport. He recognized that the objects poking out of the ground that day were clearly unusual -- he had discovered the tusks and skeleton of a mammoth.<br/><br/> <em>Lupe the Mammoth</em> was inspired by this discovery. <br/>The artwork is a technology-driven design with hand-crafted sensibilities. While the actual mammoth was a juvenile and about 8’ tall, the sculpture measures 12.5’ in height and is made of galvanized steel. The artwork was painstakingly fabricated at Paramount Roll & Forming; bent piece by piece and fit into a notched support structure after which it was galvanized for its final finish. <br/><br/> The artwork is titled “Lupe,” but has quickly assumed the nickname Lupe the Mammoth as a popular post on social media; #LupeTheMammoth. <br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Lupe-the-Mammoth-Guadalupe-Tr-559",
