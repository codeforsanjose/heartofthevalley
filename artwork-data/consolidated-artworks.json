These dangos are made of thick clay and covered in decorative glazes. When constructing these massive ceramic pieces, Kaneko starts building from the bottom up. He layers slabs of clay to shape the walls allowing the bottom to dry as he builds up to the top. Then he must fire the whole structure in a kiln without cracking or breaking it. Kaneko hopes that his sculptures will spark a dialogue around what he refers to as \u201cspiritual space.\u201d He uses the analogy of comparing a 70 story skyscraper to a 3000 meter high mountain to explain how understanding of scale changes based on environment. The public will observe this relationship between scale and environment when standing next to these grand seven foot tall sculptures.",

            "description": "The artwork is comprised of two parts:\u00a0Aton\u00a0and\u00a0Floribunda.\u00a0Aton\u00a0by definition is the disk of the sun, regarded as a deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. A 5\u2019 diameter aluminum disc frames glass roses that shoot out from the surface like solar flares. Each rose is attached to a pipe stem threaded through hieroglyphic punctures cut in the surface of the disc. The stems continue through the disc and braid into a 12 foot long \u2018stream\u2019 trailing through the lobby space. Roses, leaves and thorns adorn this \u2018stem stream\u2019. The inspiration for Aton is from two sources and the meanings prompted by their overlay are multifaceted. Framed by the disc, the rose may represent passion & friendship (red & yellow), solar flares (blossoms framed by the disc), streams of thought (intertwined stems), problems & challenges (thorns), and, perhaps, as the mystic poet Rumi might ascribe\u2014an inner luminosity essential to the rose itself.\u00a0The second piece of\u00a0Ol\u00e9\u00a0is\u00a0Floribunda\u00a0(a popular rose cultivar\u00a0group) located on fireplace chimney. This element is a metal piece\u00a0with water jet cut hieroglyphics mounted on the chimney with a\u00a0stream of glass roses randomly placed from mantle to ceiling.\u00a0The blown glass and aluminum artwork\u00a0explores the natural world in the context of the world of knowledge\u00a0and reason \u2013 historic and contemporary.",

The windows are a striking feature viewed from either the interior or exterior. During the afternoon they create colorful patterns reminiscent of light through leaves on the inside of the library; while in the evening, light from the library emanates outward through the windows.",

The first is a reading/sitting area, inspired by one of Doris\u2019 favorite activities: story telling. The reading area provides a place to sit and share stories in the traditional manner of gathering in a circle. The decomposed granite interior of the circle extends outward to the sidewalk forming the overall shape of a keyhole, a reflection of Doris\u2019 belief that reading is a key to learning and knowledge, which she shared through teaching.The second element is a series of nine large smooth-surfaced granite stones that are placed throughout the Liquid Amber Tree grove where the project is sited. \u00a0Each stone is inscribed with a ribbon containing words from one of the elements of language: nouns, verbs, etc. The words chosen and sandblasted into the stones were collected inspired by Doris Dillon\u2019s life and work. In the same spirit in which Doris fostered learning through play, the stones can serve as a playful learning tool for future generations: rubbings can be done on the stones with pencil and paper, with students moving from stone to stone, gathering a noun from one, a verb from another and onward until a full sentence is collected.This commemorative artwork honors Doris Dillon\u2019s legacy of mixing learning with pleasure in the form of a gift to the community she loved so well.",

Angela Buenning Filo was inspired to photograph these trees by a November 10th, 2002 newspaper article that described a San Jose prune orchard as the last in Silicon Valley. She drove in search of it and found the strip of trees alongside the IBM campus on Cottle Road and photographed the trees. When, in the following months Filo's thoughts kept returning to the trees, she decided to document the orchard before it was destroyed. It was then she set out to make an individual portrait of each of the orchard\u2019s 1,737 trees with the intention of arranging the finished photographs in the same grid in which the trees were planted in the orchard. By this time IBM, which had preserved the orchard on its property for decades, had sold the land, and a large billboard announced that the 42 acres were up for sale again. Filo worked over the next three years, choosing to photograph the trees\u2019 leafless branches in winter under overcast skies. With the orchard still standing, but the land slated for development, she photographed the final tree in 2006.",

Connecting the community to the station via the eight minute duration.All the elements complement each other to create a rich understanding of time in the context of Fire Station 24.The first element is the LED Countdown Timer placed over the apparatus bay. The timer is connected to the fire pager system; when a response call is received it\u00a0automatically starts an 8-minute counter that travels as a light across the sign. After the 8-minute light completes its travel across the sign, the \"call time\" is added to a list of the 8 most recent call times displayed on the sign. The second and third components of the artwork are a series of tiles in the fire station entryway. One set of tiles is a compilation of text about the number 8 and 8-minute duration. For example: \u201cA fallen or lying down 8 is used to represent infinity in mathematics.\u201d The third component is a series of 8-minute time-lapsed community photographs that depict every day activities to the same time frame of the recommended standard response time \u2013 to provide visitors to the station a visceral sense of the anxiety-filled 8 minutes awaiting emergency response versus the same 8-minutes washing a car, skateboarding or barbecuing.",

The rich colors, lines and forms in these murals flow up the stairway and wrap around corners, providing interplay with the architectural lines and fields of light.   Spiritual Stonehenge is a vinyl mural on the ground floor that creates a vibrant field of color as it wraps around the Center\u2019s juice bar, extending into the community room. Mural work is included on the juice bar\u2019s sliding door so that the mural\u2019s appearance changes depending on the position of that door. Spiritual Stonehenge continues to the outside of the building on the north entrance, providing colorful backdrop to Jackie Brookner\u2019s exterior public art. Martinez\u2019s untitled chromed and painted steel sculpture is in the 2nd floor art room. The artist intends for the imagery in the artwork to suggest elements of the history of the park, the area, and the street culture of the area\u2019s youth so that it might function as a new type of urban folk art.",

Each of the 21 water-jet cut stainless\u00a0steel panels is unique with 74 unique cast glass and bronze\u00a0sculptures, some with gold leaf, mounted along its length. \u00a0The narrative elements\u00a0within the length of the artwork are drawn\u00a0from the natural and social histories of the site.\u00a0Themes of exploration and discovery are\u00a0emphasized in a variety of ways, including the\u00a0creation of a sight line game related to the title of\u00a0the work. The repeated use of weaving (in\u00a0representational forms, and in more abstract\u00a0renderings of roadways and paths) is intended to\u00a0suggest the complexity and organization of\u00a0human knowledge. Likewise, the illustration of\u00a0locally-cultivated fruits in grid patterns refers not\u00a0only to the agricultural history of orchards near\u00a0the site, but also to the gathering and\u00a0categorization of information as it occurs in a library.\u00a0Pastoral imagery dominates the work, remembering and\u00a0celebrating ways of life which have largely vanished from\u00a0the area.",

These ideas inspired this 6\u2019 diameter granite seating element. Handprints on the side of the tree were collected from local community members and children at the Grant Elementary School, and in the center is an abbreviated history of the site \u2013 echoing the role rings play in marking the age of a tree.

To the first person or group to successfully crack the new code, Adobe will award bragging rights and acknowledgment on both the Adobe website and the San Jos\u00e9 Semaphore website.Adobe's Almaden Tower is situated directly beneath the flight path for aircraft landing at the Mineta San Jos\u00e9 International Airport, and the San Jos\u00e9 Semaphore is sensitive to the passage of aircraft above it. When a plane flies overhead, the wheels react visibly to the disturbance, and its steady rhythm is broken. After the plane has passed, the disks resume their steady, purposeful transmission. San Jos\u00e9 Semaphore functions as a beacon in the San Jos\u00e9 skyline. It is a large and beautiful machine for communication, a slow-motion magnifier for digital communications. Unlike digital transmissions that pass invisibly through the air and through microscopic circuitry, the San Jos\u00e9 Semaphore\u2019s communication efforts are visible for all to see.",

The image depicts a man carrying a bushel basket. In the background is an oak tree symbolizing the eternal quality of the natural world. The right panel depicts a female figure with children dancing around her. She faces the children with her arms stretched upward seeming to hold a transparent sphere. The sphere symbolizes the limitless possibilities of the future.   Both panels are painted on a gilt silver background (gold over silver). A limited palette of cinnabar-colored pigment is used. The silver and cinnabar reference the local mercury mines that played an important part in the development of the Almaden area. The mural has a stylistic affinity to the murals created through the federal WPA program in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s. The connection to this rich heritage is important to artists\u2019 vision for the work.\u00a0 Evans and Brown also created two decorative murals for the Children\u2019s Areas in the Library and Community wings of the building. As its name conveys, Enchanted Forest suggests themes of a whimsical enchanted forest.",

            "description": "In 2010, Kipp Kobayashi and Marta Perlas created these iconic columns for the entrance to Fire Station 19. The concept for the columns was influenced by the multi-functional role each firefighter plays on the team. Also it was influenced by the community and its diversity, as well as how the community relates to and perceives the firefighters (and vice versa). The 8\u2019 tall columns bases are articulated like the equipment fittings found on the rigs and hydrants. On the stainless steel columns are etched images of firefighters and historic firefighters from cultures from throughout history: 1) Wildland firefighter, 2) Explorers (youth firefighter program), 3) Vigiles Urbani (the first organized fire brigade of Europe), 4) Knight of Malta (where the current Maltese cross on firefighters emblem originated), 5) Edo Firefighter (early Japanese firefighter) and 6) Sapeurs-Pompiers (the first professional firefighters from the French Army of the 19th century). Each column is divided into three parts that can be turned individually, like a section of a mix \u2018n match puzzle so that the figures can be morphed into any number of combinations.",

The canopy is created with six interlocking steel rings intricately held in tension by steel cables, covered by translucent polycarbonates 'leaves.'Critical to Yang\u2019s concept for the artwork is the gathering of spoken ideas. Adjacent to the Tree is the project\u2019s sculptural sound \u201cbooth\u201d (the \u201cSeed\u201d) where a sensor activated, audible prompt, encourages community to leave a short voice message.\u00a0 Once a day before morning, messages are wirelessly transmitted to sound equipment housed at the center of the canopy (the \u201cFruit\u201d), where audio messages are reassembled to create the haiku-like whispers within the Tree. Some whispers remain over time; others fall away into an ever-evolving ambient music-like soundscape that the artist describes as a \u201cself-sustaining ecology of ideas",

            "description": "Addressing the mid-century agricultural labor history in East San Jos\u00e9, the artist worked with the project architects to design the shape of the rotunda, the columns, the terrazzo flooring and window openings at the Hillview Library. Each of the eight free-standing structural columns is composed of a stack of tractor tires; curved staves milled from recycled old-growth redwood, which are evocative of a harvest basket; the stainless steel can that pays homage to the canneries; and madrone branches, an indigenous tree revered by the local Ohlone Native Americans. Trachtenberg was also captivated by the intrinsic beauty of the farmed landscape, inspiration which she captured and reflected in the other component of Groundwork: a series of twenty-six paintings called The Shadow Frieze. The paintings that encircle the rotunda below the window openings evoke the aerial views of tilled earth, orchards, and crop rows.  These were created in 2007.  ",

Origin is comprised of several integral elements. A gilded, nine-foot diameter tower\u00a0rises 45\u2019 from the lower level\u2019s terrazzo floor. The terrazzo floor design, which can easily be\u00a0seen from the upper levels and the staircase as one\u00a0descends, is derived from the pattern of an early\u00a0integrated circuit. Natural granite boulders placed\u00a0within the floor space provide informal seating. Upon further exploration the viewer\u00a0looks up to a suspended tree-root system covered in gold leaf. An elegant spectrum of ever unfolding colored lights play across the interior surfaces of the tower and\u00a0interactwith the suspended gilded root system. This play of light patterns isthe result of a solar light sculpture at the roof level which gatherssunlight and projects it through a series of mirrors to an imagingmechanism inside the tower.",

The artwork builds on the idea of age rings in the cross-section of a tree\u00a0trunk: images in each concentric ring speak to a specific period\u00a0of history and growth in the region, from the earliest period of\u00a0indigenous inhabitants to the present.\u00a0Bibliotree\u00a0is sculptural element in the\u00a0form of a tall flourishing tree made of water jet cut steel. The cut outs in the trunk are\u00a0letters from the alphabets of the many languages contained in\u00a0the Library's collection. On the lower branches of the tree are\u00a0books and objects associated with reading; these continue onto\u00a0the higher branches, which also contain objects representing\u00a0newer forms of media. In this way the work suggests a developmental progression: the roots of language in letters and alphabets flourish into literature and on into other media.\u00a0Orchard Walk,\u00a026 thematic sidewalk insets made of stainless\u00a0steel and flamed granite, are embedded in the concrete along\u00a0the walkway that runs between Santa Teresa Blvd. and the Library entrance. The insets each feature the title of a literary,\u00a0media or music reference, each with a different fruit in the title along with the\u00a0author\u2019s, director\u2019s or composer\u2019s name and a corresponding fruit image. The\u00a0titles were drawn from world literature and media as well as items in the\u00a0Library collection.\u00a0Orchard Walk\u00a0also includes a \"welcome mat\" in the main entrance to the\u00a0Library. It contains whimsical images of two people, male and female,\u00a0tending a garden and framed in the words \"Cultivate Your Mind in the\u00a0Orchard of Knowledge,\" the artist\u2019s unifying theme for the group of artworks.",

            "description": "The San Jos\u00e9 Public Art Program in association with project developer Blake Hunt Ventures, commissioned Einar and Jamex de la Torre to collaborate with the community in the creation of artwork for the Story & King Development. The artists created three different artworks, positioned in locations throughout the shopping center parking lot and also on the front and side wall of the Target store. The three distinct works make reference to historic Mexican art forms while integrating the artists' distinct and often humorous take on contemporary culture.  The de la Torre brothers incorporate time-honored styles such as Mexican folk art and  symbols of Catholicism as well as universal subjects such gender roles and cultural integration. As a result, viewers of their work are able to place one foot in the worlds of pre-Columbian Mexico while the other is planted firmly in contemporary society",

The artwork consists of two elements: a vertical 30\u2019 sculptural representation of a glider wing formed of tubular steel and covered in steel mesh, and the colored concrete plaza textured with linear patterns that flow around the wing element in an airflow pattern similar to that around an ascending plane wing. Soaring Flight is positioned with Montgomery Hill as a backdrop, the site of many of his pioneering flights. Phrases and quotes associated with Montgomery\u2019s work are sandblasted into the plaza; benches are placed around the perimeter of the plaza. Together these elements create, in Roberts\u2019 words,  \u201cA haven where visitors may learn about local history and Montgomery specifically, as well as reflect upon human invention...a subject so significantly linked to San Jose.\u201d  ",

            "description": "Anna Valentina Murch\u2019s Garden Park is situated in Edenvale Park next to the historic Hayes Mansion. Through public meetings, Murch discovered that the community wanted an artwork that was inspired by the vast history of the site. They asked for the piece to incorporate elements of the indigenous people of the valley, the agricultural era, Frontier Village - the 1960s era amusement park located on the site, the Hayes family orchards, and the garden of Mary Hayes. They also desired an artwork that revolved around a theme of transition, both physically and symbolically, to represent the transformation of the park through the master plan and the restoration of wildlife. Lastly, they hoped that Murch\u2019s artwork would be a place of contemplation and peace. Murch\u2019s artwork features a stone circle in the middle of the garden covered in round holes, reminiscent of Native American pounding holes, which function as waterholes for wildlife. To the north of the stone circle is an oak grove, which also references indigenous people who were dependent upon acorns as a staple of their diet. Ornamental cherry trees are planted to the west and east of the circle in remembrance of the Hayes\u2019s orchard and the valley\u2019s agricultural past. A bridge leads away from the circle towards the mansion over a moat of wildflowers in honor of Frontier Village. Lavender is found on the far edge of the oak grove, creating a rich scent nostalgic of Mary Hayes\u2019 healing garden. This peaceful artwork provides an area for quiet meditation on the transition of the seasons and the transformation of the park\u2019s historic value. Students from neighboring elementary, middle and high schools participated in the creation of the artwork and, in the past, used it as a touchstone for a curriculum about the community.",

From the moment we are born we begin the process of discovery that continues throughout our lives.  For that reason I have decided to title the sculptures Discoveries.\u201d  The concept of the pieces was to suggest the universal human potential for exploration and learning through our senses.The three large white marble stones were found in Carrara, Italy in the same place where Michelangelo sourced stone for his carvings over 500 years ago. The carving of the stones into an ear, mouth, and eye, show the human forms emerging out of the rough hewn boulders. It is a balance of the beauty of the natural stone and the beautiful carving of the human forms. ",

Water from the creek flows into a series of water features starting with a circular pool in which water continuously drips from a bamboo pipe disturbing the tranquil surface of the water. A second pool is at the center of this feature formed by a weir (a small overflow dam used to alter the flow of a river or stream). Water flows over the edge of the weir to a natural pond below decorated \u00a0with mud-like imprints of animal tracks, plant impressions, and human marks.  A bench made of concrete, sandstone, and granite sits next to the water features and is decorated with the image of ripples in a pool. The steel canopy\u2019s leaf and animal silhouettes cast a dappled light effect on the bench.  The ball washer is activated like a drinking fountain. The spiral motion of the golf ball as it is washed acts as a meditative and focusing activity for golfers.",

From afar, the bench appears to be a sculpture, but upon further exploration, one discovers that it is also a private bench to contemplate the view.  The inspiration for the form of the bench is drawn from nature, such as a seed pod or leaf. The spiral designs represents a spirit of renewal and the cycle of life. Thus,  Meditation Bench is intended to connect the sitter to the environment of Groesbeck Hill Park, and the beauty of the natural forms found in nature. ",

The phrase \u201cshow your stripes\u201d has long been used to indicate social or political position; show what you\u2019re made of, which side are you on. At one point in history, stripes were relegated to the margins of society: jugglers, courtesans, and in Medieval paintings the devil is often shown wearing stripes. Over time, stripes have taken on a more positive connotation: freedom, playfulness, or with banker\u2019s pinstripes \u2013 taste and status. The artwork is not simply a light show. For the changes to be activated, it takes viewer participation, as the activation phone number above indicates. A quiet reflector of the changing sky during the day, at night the piece transforms into San Jose\u2019s shared secret \u2013 the phone number a pass code to control the changing patterns. In 2015, launching the first of a series of light-based artworks that will appear throughout downtown San Jos\u00e9 as part of the \u201cIlluminating Downtown Project,\u201d the artist was invited to develop a new series of interactive programs based on community input. After completing a simple and fun survey, the Mr. Conti choreographed a sequence of unique stripes based on participants\u2019 answers.\u00a0 Some number sequences relate to a community member\u2019s favorite song or color, others are simply employed for their dynamism or beauty.

The project elements work together to stimulate community curiosity, encourage participation in best household practices, and promote environmental stewardship:Doorhanger:\u00a0 Addressing the issue directly at the household, a bold graphic poster is distributed as a door hanger by DOT crews in the vicinity of recent sanitary sewer maintenance activity. The poster features simple and engaging icons to educate about various FOG wastes and common household products not to be put in sinks; the poster also brings awareness to features of the infrastructure system. Printed in the project\u2019s signature electric green color, the door hanger connects to the other art elements described below. Multi-lingual text provides explanation and vocabulary for a more informed community.\u00a0Manhole Marker: Bringing attention to the infrastructure below the streets, manholes of recently serviced sewer lines were painted in the project\u2019s signature electric green color, creating awareness of this largely unnoticed infrastructure. Painting of the manholes coincided with the distribution of door hangers creating a connection from the front door to the system under the street.\u00a0Maintenance Truck Graphic: A bold vinyl graphic was applied to select sewer maintenance trucks traveling to the target neighborhoods that features a design that calls out the 24/7 sewer maintenance service provided by the City.

The artwork is part of the Alum Rock Cultural History Corridor (ARCHC), which seeks to celebrate the rich cultural history of east San Jos\u00e9 through artworks and other elements. Raps\u2019 sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved \u2018tines\u2019 that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow\u2019s curved 'tines', miming the harrow\u2019s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community. The arms in the artwork are castings of real community members, underscoring the artwork\u2019s connection to the area and to this community (see fact sheet for detail). Each person has a real connection to the idea represented in the work.  ",

Each pane contains characters in different scripts that are the basis for written Latin, Russian, Vietnamese and some Indian languages. These are lineages of the languages that presently are predominant in the Pearl Avenue Branch Library collection. The lamp is inscribed with ancient Sumerian cuneiform script which repeats the text \"We are all one.\" \u00a0The lamp is lit with color changing LEDs, programmed to cycle on 30-minute intervals through the color spectrum. In this way the lamp also functions as a timepiece.\u00a0Another critical but unseen aspect to the artwork are photovoltaic cells that are embedded in the four glass panes. These collect solar energy that then provides power to light the lamp. Through this work the artist is seeking to awaken people to the miracle of language and writing as the key to understanding the past, expressing the present and imagining the future. The artist also wants to raise awareness of the real possibilities of harnessing available energy to provide for basic needs.",

To address the issues arising from the controversy, the City appointed a Historic Art Advisory Committee. \u00a0 \u00a0 The committee recommended that the City's public art must represent all perspectives of the City's history. \u00a0Four additional projects were recommended - artworks commemorating the Ohlone Way of Life, the life of Dr. Ernesto Galarza, the Founding of the Pueblo, and the Agricultural History of the Valley. \u00a0These works have been installed in various locations around the city. \u00a0This artwork is a reminder that a community's historic events can be interpreted in many ways, depending upon one's perspective.",

The fish represent the diversity of individuals from many cultures that live in the Martha Gardens neighborhood.

            "description": "The movie marquee became a familiar downtown architectural feature with the popularization of cinema in the 1920's and 1930's. Its objective of transmitting information to the street was fully realized at night with illuminated displays as a form of urban seduction.\u00a0 A contemporary interpretation of the marquee suggests not only technical revision for this transmission of information, but a rethinking of urban communication. Jump Cuts reinterprets the mechanism of the marquee through sculptural, electronic and video elements, broadcasting images and texts, both informational and contemplative, to the street. The artwork transforms the visual accessibility of the lobby by alternating between the actual view from the street and live video views from within, thus flipping the building inside-out and back, electronically.\u00a0 The project includes twelve 5' by 6'- 8\" liquid-crystal display panels mounted on the outside of the glass facade of the building. By day, viewers see text permanently etched onto the surface of the glass panels.\u00a0 From the outside, the text reads, \"Truth is stranger than fiction is stranger than truth...\"\u00a0 From inside the lobby, the text reads, \"Life imitates art imitates life...\" In the evening, the LCD panels\u00a0 are transformed into video screens.\u00a0 Images projected onto the screens sequence between movie trailers and live feed from video cameras mounted inside the lobby.\u00a0 In between these sequences, the screens become transparent, allowing full view of the interior lobby.\u00a0 A computer controls all of the dynamic elements of the marquee, including activating the panels, turning them translucent and providing the surface upon which images can be projected.\u00a0 The image sequencing is preprogrammed for the twelve months of the year to begin operation at dusk and continue through midnight.",

            "description": "The design of this commemorative artwork connects San Jose State University with Plaza de Cesar Chavez, in the heart of the City's downtown.  The artwork references Dr. Ernesto Galarza\u2019s life-long pursuit of bridging academic and civil life and referencing the many facets of his work, including academia, poetry, education and labor organizing.\u00a0 The work is composed of three elements:Library Table:The surface of the cast-concrete library table is inlaid with bronze farm tools, a cast-bronze field-worker's hat, photo-etched black granite portraits, photo-etched ceramic tiles and bronze text.  The relief surface of the table is designed to encourage pedestrians to view and touch the inlaid elements.Cast Bronze ChairAt the west end of the table, facing Plaza de Cesar Chavez, an empty cast-bronze chair with a wooden seat serves as a metaphor for Dr. Galarza as the field worker who took his scholarly practice into the world.  The chair is a functional element, and is intended to encourage visitors to stop, sit and explore the information contained in the table surface.Ribbons of TerrazzoThe ribbons of terrazzo are 11\" wide and of varying length, and lace through the existing Paseo paving in each of the four blocks.  Designed to have a subtle physical and visual impact upon the Paseo, these ribbons are intended to draw the pedestrian through the length of the walkway.  The terrazzo is inlaid with bronze text, in both English and Spanish, introducing the commemoration through personal recollections about Dr. Galarza's life and work from his family, friends and colleagues.",

Like ancient Rome our contemporary culture was made possible by a vast system of water delivery and sewage treatment to maintain a large and healthy population. Most of us are generally unaware of this system until it doesn't work. Dawson's photographs of this infrastructure depict a huge, complex but delicate machine. The entire system is estimated to be valued at $2 billion. Approximately $1 billion will be needed to repair or replace parts over the next ten years. Dawson's work is intended to bring attention to this invisible part of our local government and to help generate awareness of when government works.",

The sculptural insects are of various sizes, heights\u00a0and locations attached to posts on ball\u00a0bearings that allow the sculptures to\u00a0move with the wind. Sunlight creates\u00a0additional interest by casting shadows\u00a0through the laser cut wings and\u00a0reflections off the colorful glass eyes.\u00a0\u00a0The sculptures are intended to reawaken the\u00a0relationship to the wind, sun, and water,\u00a0fundamental elements of nature in this urban\u00a0park. The sculptures also celebrate the\u00a0Guadalupe River that gives life to flora and\u00a0fauna and people of San Jose.",

The three sculptures are sited near an accessible playground in Berryessa Creek Park. Schoolchildren participated in making wishes on each of the crystals before they were incorporated into the sculptures. ",

Five Skaters honors the art and sport of\u00a0figure skating, San Jose\u2019s local champions and others who\u00a0have contributed to its vitality, tradition and popularity.\u00a0The artwork consists of three parts: five monumental\u00a0columns, a large terrazzo ice rink, and three winners'\u00a0podiums. The 20 foot-tall columns are clad with mosaics of\u00a0black, white and gray ceramic tiles featuring photographic\u00a0images of the five San Jose Area champions and convey the spirit of championship, including the pressures\u00a0of competition, the scrutiny of the judges, the presence of\u00a0the live audience, and the watchful eye of the press.The oval-shaped terrazzo rink is surrounded by built-in\u00a0seating. Thin metal strips are embedded in the terrazzo\u00a0curve throughout the rink creating patterns like those etched\u00a0in ice by skate blades. Complementing these curves, text\u00a0conveying the personal recollections of each champion\u00a0swirl about the ice. The surface of the rink also features\u00a0five recessed niches; these contain display photographs and\u00a0personal memorabilia of the San Jose area figure skating\u00a0champions.\u00a0The final element of the work is a set of three winners'\u00a0circles, cylindrical disks of varying heights; these reference\u00a0the award podiums for medalists. They are designed so that\u00a0anyone can stand on them and experience a personal\u00a0moment of championship.",

The steps rise in increments to\u00a0form terracing that appears completely natural to its setting. The installation creates a fluid motion in stone, commencing at the\u00a0top of one hill, flowing down to the base and then back up the\u00a0second hill. The title of this artwork suggests the view from\u00a0above: as seen from a bird\u2019s eye view, the work references the\u00a0shadow of a bird in flight as cast on the earth below. It is\u00a0constructed with a local stone.",

The artist inspired by this and further intrigued by the transformation of butterflies, and that as a metaphor for the human life process from childhood to maturity. With these ideas in mind Ms. Liew created Trees of Knowledge: two \"trees\" formed by integrating painted elements, positioned to suggest treetops, onto columns of the building. Their shape also echoes that of butterfly wings and each is painted with rich, colorful mythological imagery. Ms. Liew suggests that these, \"serve as a gateway to the world of imagination and learning that await the visitors to the Children's section of the library.\" \u00a0 Ms. Liew's Metamorphosis - Transformation in the Woods is a painting in the form of butterfly wings. Located in the Storytelling Corner, these are positioned so as to frame the storyteller. Colorful imagery on the wings references characters from classic fairytales, nursery rhymes set in the forest, and folklore and is intended to inspire positive themes for young readers.",

Draping across the roof line of The Pierce, a residential apartment building in Downtown San Jose, Voxel Cloud serves as a gateway marker for San Jos\u00e9\u2019s SoFA Art District, The dynamic, illuminated, data-driven LED sculpture takes its visual cues from natural forms as varied as water particles, interstellar star systems, the crystalline aggregates of silicon carbide, and the multi-chromatic raw materials of semiconductor wafers.  Voxel Cloud was made possible through a partnership between the project owner/developer, Sares Regis Group of Northern California, Pritzker Realty Group, and the City of San Jos\u00e9 Public Art Program. It was supported in part by an ArtPlace grant (www.artplaceamerica.org). It is the fifth of six Illuminating Downtown Project (IDP) grants awarded for creative placemaking projects in San Jos\u00e9, bringing artists and arts organizations together to enrich the city and its communities. IDP combines art and technology to physically manifest San Jos\u00e9\u2019s aspiration for creating a more engaging downtown\u2014whether someone is approaching from the surrounding freeways or walking its streets. It was built in 2017. ",

The fields slope from Santa Clara Street toward the City Hall plaza allowing the water to flow down the surface of the fields onto the plaza in subtle ripples. Water also flows over the vertical stone on the fountain edges, disappearing beneath the plaza, creating walls of water that define the perimeter along Santa Clara Street. The water within the field is programmed to respond to changes in time of day, temperature, season and availability of water to create different visual, sonic and atmospheric qualities. The piece is illuminated at night for a distinctive evening identity.",

In 2003, Ries Niemi collaborated with nearby middle and high school students to incorporate their drawings as metal panels decorating the opening gate, front doorway, and walls of the youth center. While the artist translated some of the drawings for a cohesive style, the artwork is still distinctively based on the youths\u2019 artwork. The shape of the chandelier, hanging in the oculus of the lobby, celebrate the themes of life with sculptural elements that look like DNA strands or plant forms.  The use of colored mirrors and gems, reflected by the embedded mirrors, change due to sunlight, thus causing the impact of the piece to shift throughout the day.  ",

All the elements are based on objects, images and ideas cultivated by the artists from the community.  The artists engaged in extensive interaction with the Edenvale community in the creation of the artwork. They went out to schools, neighborhood and community gatherings, youth centers and the library to encourage community members to Be a Part of the Art by contributing objects, stories, photos and memorabilia that represented their own lives.

This sign is comprised of two parts\u2014the practical wayfinding text, and the surrounding cellular image forms. The cellular pattern was made using Voronoi diagrams for points that are algorithmically distributed through the panel and concentrated within the letter forms. So, abstractly the cells are defined by the letters and the surrounding images themselves. The \u201cTech Connect\u201d sign was designed by Michael Thompson of Coded Meaning, a frequent collaborator with Ms. Wagner.",

            "description": "One July Saturday in 2005, a San Jose resident took a walk with his dog along the Guadalupe River, just north of the San Jose International Airport. He recognized that the objects poking out of the ground that day were clearly unusual -- he had discovered the tusks and skeleton of a mammoth. Lupe the Mammoth was inspired by this discovery. The artwork is a technology-driven design with hand-crafted sensibilities. While the actual mammoth was a juvenile and about 8\u2019 tall, the sculpture measures 12.5\u2019 in height and is made of galvanized steel. The artwork was painstakingly fabricated at Paramount Roll & Forming; bent piece by piece and fit into a notched support structure after which it was galvanized for its final finish.  The artwork is titled \u201cLupe,\u201d but has quickly assumed the nickname Lupe the Mammoth as a popular post on social media; #LupeTheMammoth.  ",

            "description": "The design of\u00a0Echo\u00a0grew out of discussions between\u00a0the artist and architect and their desire to define the\u00a0nighttime identity of the building and enliven the\u00a0nighttime identity of the downtown.\u00a0On San Fernando Street, the vertical spaces of the elevator towers read as\u00a0monolithic volumes of light in three colors. As one\u00a0color slowly dims another color is brought up in\u00a0intensity to fill the volume of space. The elevators\u00a0themselves have standard incandescent lights and are\u00a0visible traveling through the volume of color.Centered\u00a0within the nine foot by six foot bays of the building, behind the perforated metal fa\u00e7ade, are 24 three-foot\u00a0squares of neon light controlled by individual random fading transformers. The rectangular mass created\u00a0by the 24 boxes illuminates the building fa\u00e7ade. The squares of light float, change color, and fade\u00a0constantly, but subtly, create new patterns and compositions.",
