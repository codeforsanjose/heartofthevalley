      "description": "1737 Trees\r\n\r\n1737 Trees is a grid of photographic portraits of every tree in one of San Jose’s last orchards.\r\nAngela Buenning Filo was inspired to photograph these trees by a November 10th, 2002 newspaper article that described a San Jose prune orchard as the last in Silicon Valley. She drove in search of it and found the strip of trees alongside the IBM campus on Cottle Road and photographed the trees. When, in the following months Filo's thoughts kept returning to the trees, she decided to document the orchard before it was destroyed. It was then she set out to make an individual portrait of each of the orchard’s 1,737 trees with the intention of arranging the finished photographs in the same grid in which the trees were planted in the orchard.\r\nBy this time IBM, which had preserved the orchard on its property for decades, had sold the land, and a large billboard announced that the 42 acres were up for sale again. Filo worked over the next three years, choosing to photograph the trees’ leafless branches in winter under overcast skies. With the orchard still standing, but the land slated for development, she photographed the final tree in 2006.",

On one side of the memorial the panels depict life prior to the internment, showing a robust, prosperous community. The other side portrays various aspects of the history and reality of life in the internment camps. There are images of Franklin Roosevelt signing Executive Order 9066 issuing the internment policy, notices for internment being sent to people of Japanese ancestry, the daily of life of the camps, and adjustment after the war. The final panel portrays the 1988 Redress in which a formal apology and compensation was issued to every survivor. In a column at the end of the wall, many \"mon\" (traditional family crests) sent in by community members are also displayed.\r\nThe memorial visualizes the inhumanity and strife of the internment camps and reminds the public that fear of the “other” can lead to broad spread racism, prejudice, and discrimination.",

      "description": "Teaching Stones\r\nArtist Team: Academy of Art University Graduate Students under the direction of Professor Donna Schumacher (2007)\r\nTeaching Stones is a tribute to Doris Dillon, a beloved teacher and community member. Doris Dillon was known for her generous spirit and passion for teaching.  She engaged students through games, and it was often said that she could “teach a rock to read.”\r\nTeaching Stones consists of two primary elements. The first is a reading/sitting area, inspired by one of Doris’ favorite activities: story telling. The reading area provides a place to sit and share stories in the traditional manner of gathering in a circle. The decomposed granite interior of the circle extends outward to the sidewalk forming the overall shape of a keyhole, a reflection of Doris’ belief that reading is a key to learning and knowledge, which she shared through teaching.\r\nThe second element is a series of nine large smooth-surfaced granite stones that are placed throughout the Liquid Amber Tree grove where the project is sited.  Each stone is inscribed with a ribbon containing words from one of the elements of language: nouns, verbs, etc. The words chosen and sandblasted into the stones were collected inspired by Doris Dillon’s life and work. In the same spirit in which Doris fostered learning through play, the stones can serve as a playful learning tool for future generations: rubbings can be done on the stones with pencil and paper, with students moving from stone to stone, gathering a noun from one, a verb from another and onward until a full sentence is collected.\r\nThis commemorative artwork honors Doris Dillon’s legacy of mixing learning with pleasure in the form of a gift to the community she loved so well.",

      "description": "A Monument to the Last Barn\r\n\r\n\r\nA native of San Jose, Emma Prusch bequeathed her 47 acre dairy farm to the City in 1962. The deed to the City specified that the City “will make said park a place of relaxation, recreation, and enjoyment for the people of the City of San Jose, and in such a manner as will, to extent that such can be reasonably done, give to said park a rural county character and atmosphere.” Emma Prusch Farm Park includes heritage, high density, and rare fruit orchards, a Plant Science Center, two community gardens, pollinator and butterfly gardens, as well as acres of lush green lawns for picnics and playing. It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine.\r\nThe artist was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San Jose's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. A Monument to the Last Barn draws upon this influence: the form is a four-sided metal structure derived from traditional Santa Clara barns, but stripped of outer cladding to reveal the essential framework. This iconic linkage to early barns is further underscored by the rich, deep barn red color of the piece. The barn’s corrugated galvanized steel roof is topped with three golden wind vanes depicting a rooster, a windmill and an apple. The gables and railings are inset with filigree screens in a bold “fruits and leaves” pattern, representing the orchards that were so vital to the region. Benches placed inside the barn create an inviting and reflective atmosphere amidst the lively park grounds. The artist conceived of this work as homage to the last great large barn on the site at Prusch Farm Park.",

      "description": "8 Minutes\r\n\r\n \r\nThe National Fire Protection Association recommends a target of 8 minutes as “standard response time” for emergency calls. The artwork 8 Minutes approaches the topic of the 8-minute response in three ways:\r\n\r\n    A visual measurement of 8 minutes,\r\n    A conveyor of Fire Station 24th continuous efforts on behalf of the community, and\r\n    Connecting the community to the station via the eight minute duration.\r\n\r\nAll the elements complement each other to create a rich understanding of time in the context of Fire Station 24.\r\nThe first element is the LED Countdown Timer placed over the apparatus bay. The timer is connected to the fire pager system; when a response call is received it automatically starts an 8-minute counter that travels as a light across the sign. After the 8-minute light completes its travel across the sign, the \"call time\" is added to a list of the 8 most recent call times displayed on the sign. The second and third components of the artwork are a series of tiles in the fire station entryway. One set of tiles is a compilation of text about the number 8 and 8-minute duration. For example: “A fallen or lying down 8 is used to represent infinity in mathematics.” The third component is a series of 8-minute time-lapsed community photographs that depict every day activities to the same time frame of the recommended standard response time – to provide visitors to the station a visceral sense of the anxiety-filled 8 minutes awaiting emergency response versus the same 8-minutes washing a car, skateboarding or barbecuing.",

Trees encompass an iconic role in community life. Throughout time trees have served as gathering places, and learning takes place beneath their branches. Such trees become part of a community’s sense of self and even when they disappear, they remain in the community’s collective sense of place. These ideas inspired this 6’ diameter granite seating element. Handprints on the side of the tree were collected from local community members and children at the Grant Elementary School, and in the center is an abbreviated history of the site – echoing the role rings play in marking the age of a tree. Incised in the ground are “shadows” of branches overhead.",

      "description": "Untitled - Edenvale Garden Park\r\n\r\nAnna Valentina Murch’s Garden Park is situated in Edenvale Park next to the historic Hayes Mansion. Through public meetings, Murch discovered that the community wanted an artwork that was inspired by the vast history of the site. They asked for the piece to incorporate elements of the indigenous people of the valley, the agricultural era, Frontier Village - the 1960s era amusement park located on the site, the Hayes family orchards, and the garden of Mary Hayes. They also desired an artwork that revolved around a theme of transition, both physically and symbolically, to represent the transformation of the park through the master plan and the restoration of wildlife. Lastly, they hoped that Murch’s artwork would be a place of contemplation and peace.\r\nMurch’s artwork features a stone circle in the middle of the garden covered in round holes, reminiscent of Native American pounding holes, which function as waterholes for wildlife. To the north of the stone circle is an oak grove, which also references indigenous people who were dependent upon acorns as a staple of their diet. Ornamental cherry trees are planted to the west and east of the circle in remembrance of the Hayes’s orchard and the valley’s agricultural past. A bridge leads away from the circle towards the mansion over a moat of wildflowers in honor of Frontier Village. Lavender is found on the far edge of the oak grove, creating a rich scent nostalgic of Mary Hayes’ healing garden.\r\nThis peaceful artwork provides an area for quiet meditation on the transition of the seasons and the transformation of the park’s historic value. Students from neighboring elementary, middle and high schools participated in the creation of the artwork and, in the past, used it as a touchstone for a curriculum about the community.",

      "description": "Untitled\r\n\r\nThe main theme of the artwork is Cemanahuac: the location of the individual within his/her community as well as within the cosmos.\r\nAccording to Mesoamerican indigenous cultures and oral traditions, each of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) corresponds to an element, a community memory of value, a time of day, and a color of corn a fundamental agricultural symbol: East is fire, family, sunrise, and red corn West is wind, local heroes, sunset, and yellow corn South is earth, work, noon, and blue corn North is water, history, night, and white corn.  These symbols honor the Mexican community in various forms throughout the plaza:\r\n\r\n    Four patterned metal grilles in the windows of the tower introduce traditional ironwork with pre-Columbian designs. Metal work is continued in each of the gates into the plaza. Mosaic thresholds inside the gates explore the theme of location and direction. The thresholds were inspired by mosaics commonly seen in Mexican colonial cities such as Taxco, Puebla and Tlaxcala and mosaic work in San Jose. \r\n    The garden alcoves are offering places linked by thematic press tiles to the cardinal directions and dedicated to a community value. The tiles were created by community members during a series of public workshops. The photographic tiles were translated from family albums and personal collections contributed by the local community. \r\n    A recurring image of the hummingbird, derived from Mesoamerican motifs, can be seen at the water fountain and on two accent walls at the south and east entrances. The hummingbird, an ancient Mesoamerican talisman, is a symbol of love and the warrior spirit. It is common in San Jose, a tiny but tenacious bird that migrates thousands of miles from Mexico to California every year and plays a role in shaping the landscape by pollinating the plants from which it drinks nectar. The hummingbird motif is intended to speak to the spirit of immigrant citizens, their endurance, strength, tenacity, and their contributions to the culture and nature of California. The choices of planting materials in the garden were selected to attract hummingbirds.",

      "description": "Urban Rooms\r\n\r\nUrban Rooms is a new identity to Parque de los Pobladores and a gateway to SoFA and Downtown. Artist Estudio Teddy Cruz + Forman designed the small park as a dynamic platform for cultural programs and event productions. Artist-designed shade structures, urban furniture and curtain walls accommodate many different community interactions for artists, performers, and entrepreneurs – as well as everyday uses of this important public space.\r\nMore about the elements of Urban Rooms:\r\n\r\n    The Pavilion-Tiendas are simple steel structures that are distributed across the open plaza to configure four ‘urban rooms,’ which together form a series of shading zones and areas for activity. Each steel armature is clad in brightly colored vinyl-coated chain-link systems, to provide shade and texture. Additional shading is provided by a removable triangular fabric canopy that can be suspended under each of the pavilions. \r\n    The Urban Art Platform is an open stage that will allow for variety of arts and cultural performances and activities. The platform is constructed from a steel frame clad in a vibrant yellow durable, nautical-grade fiberglass grating.\r\n    To further activate the plaza, custom curtains have been provided to ‘enclose’ the spaces beneath the pavilions. These drapes can be configured in various ways to direct pedestrian circulation in the plaza enabling the transformation of the plaza across time, becoming a market, a gallery, a classroom, or performance space, etc.\r\n    The surface of the plaza is painted to mitigate the heat produced by the large, previously untreated concrete-slab surface, while demarcating activity and functional areas.\r\n\r\nThe project was funded by a $200,000 National Endowment of the Arts Our Town Grant with additional support provided by ArtPlace America. The City of San José’s Office of Cultural Affairs Public Art Program and Movimiento de Arte y Cultura Latino Americana (MACLA) collaborated in its creation.",

Like ancient Rome our contemporary culture was made possible by a vast system of water delivery and sewage treatment to maintain a large and healthy population. Most of us are generally unaware of this system until it doesn't work. Dawson's photographs of this infrastructure depict a huge, complex but delicate machine. The entire system is estimated to be valued at $2 billion. Approximately $1 billion will be needed to repair or replace parts over the next ten years. Dawson's work is intended to bring attention to this invisible part of our local government and to help generate awareness of when government works.",

It memorializes the raising of the U.S. flag in San Jose in 1846, when California was still a part of Mexico.  Scheduled to be installed in 1990, the statue generated an intense controversy.  Supporters of the artwork believed that it commemorated an important historical event in San Jose's history.  Opponents of the statue responded that it represented a troubling moment in American history, when the United States used the Mexican -American War as a reason to annex California from Mexico.\r\nTo address the issues arising from the controversy, the City appointed a Historic Art Advisory Committee.     The committee recommended that the City's public art must represent all perspectives of the City's history.  Four additional projects were recommended - artworks commemorating the Ohlone Way of Life, the life of Dr. Ernesto Galarza, the Founding of the Pueblo, and the Agricultural History of the Valley.  These works have been installed in various locations around the city.\r\nThis artwork is a reminder that a community's historic events can be interpreted in many ways, depending upon one's perspective.",

      "description": "Show Your Stripes\r\n(Private Percent for Art)\r\n\r\nShow Your Stripes follows the artist’s interest in the use of patterns. The phrase “show your stripes” has long been used to indicate social or political position; show what you’re made of, which side are you on. At one point in history, stripes were relegated to the margins of society: jugglers, courtesans, and in Medieval paintings the devil is often shown wearing stripes. Over time, stripes have taken on a more positive connotation: freedom, playfulness, or with banker’s pinstripes – taste and status.\r\nThe artwork is not simply a light show. For the changes to be activated, it takes viewer participation, as the activation phone number above indicates. A quiet reflector of the changing sky during the day, at night the piece transforms into San Jose’s shared secret – the phone number a pass code to control the changing patterns.\r\nIn 2015, launching the first of a series of light-based artworks that will appear throughout downtown San José as part of the “Illuminating Downtown Project,” the artist was invited to develop a new series of interactive programs based on community input. After completing a simple and fun survey, the Mr. Conti choreographed a sequence of unique stripes based on participants’ answers.  Some number sequences relate to a community member’s favorite song or color, others are simply employed for their dynamism or beauty. A menu of over 300 codes is available in the document section above.\r\nArtwork Activation\r\n\r\n    Call (408) 287-0128\r\n    After The Tone, Enter any 3 digit combination from 1 - 9 \r\n    Press “0” (Zero), Then Hang Up\r\n    \r\n    Note: Not all combinations are programmed – yet.",

Spiritual Stonehenge is a vinyl mural on the ground floor that creates a vibrant field of color as it wraps around the Center’s juice bar, extending into the community room. Mural work is included on the juice bar’s sliding door so that the mural’s appearance changes depending on the position of that door. Spiritual Stonehenge continues to the outside of the building on the north entrance, providing colorful backdrop to Jackie Brookner’s exterior public art.\r\nMartinez’s untitled chromed and painted steel sculpture is in the 2nd floor art room.

      "description": "San Jose Semaphore\r\n\r\nThe San José Public Art Program in association with Adobe Systems, commissioned artist Ben Rubin in the creation of artwork for Adobe's Amaden Tower.  Not unlike the Semaphore Telegraphs of the 18th century, each wheel of the San José Semaphore can assume four distinct positions and together, the four wheels have a vocabulary of 256 possible combinations that turn into new positions every 7.2 seconds pulsing out a coded message, the content of which is a mystery left as a challenge for the viewers to decipher.\r\nAs of October 2012, a new code is being displayed; cracking the encryption technique and deciphering the message is posed as a challenge for the public. To the first person or group to successfully crack the new code, Adobe will award bragging rights and acknowledgment on both the Adobe website and the San José Semaphore website.\r\nAdobe's Almaden Tower is situated directly beneath the flight path for aircraft landing at the Mineta San José International Airport, and the San José Semaphore is sensitive to the passage of aircraft above it. When a plane flies overhead, the wheels react visibly to the disturbance, and its steady rhythm is broken. After the plane has passed, the disks resume their steady, purposeful transmission.\r\nSan José Semaphore functions as a beacon in the San José skyline. It is a large and beautiful machine for communication, a slow-motion magnifier for digital communications. Unlike digital transmissions that pass invisibly through the air and through microscopic circuitry, the San José Semaphore's communication efforts are visible for all to see.",

Each pane contains characters in different scripts that are the basis for written Latin, Russian, Vietnamese and some Indian languages. These are lineages of the languages that presently are predominant in the Pearl Avenue Branch Library collection.\r\nThe lamp is inscribed with ancient Sumerian cuneiform script which repeats the text \"We are all one.\"  The lamp is lit with color changing LEDs, programmed to cycle on 30-minute intervals through the color spectrum. In this way the lamp also functions as a timepiece. Another critical but unseen aspect to the artwork are photovoltaic cells that are embedded in the four glass panes. These collect solar energy that then provides power to light the lamp.\r\nThrough this work the artist is seeking to awaken people to the miracle of language and writing as the key to understanding the past, expressing the present and imagining the future. The artist also wants to raise awareness of the real possibilities of harnessing available energy to provide for basic needs.",

The design is presented  as  if  the  parts could be snapped out of their frame and reassembled.  Small  portraits, reflective of faces found in the community, are embedded within the artwork. The artwork is intended to serve as a colorful “bridge” between the Library’s entrance and the Children’s area.  Potential  also suggests a metaphor for the process  of  transformation.  It  demonstrates how, in the creation of a low rider bicycle, an old junk  bicycle frame is modified,restored and transformed into something new and beautiful.",

It captures the spirit of the path meant to highlight the passage of the seasons and give homage to the site’s agricultural past.\r\nThe Path of Ten Thousand Leaves meanders through the 32-acre park with a large circular seating area at the center of the path. The 1800 foot path is embossed with black walnut and apricrot leaves, thus making the emphemereal process of leaves falling permanent. The embossed leaves also have a fossil-like design nostalgic of the fruit orchards that used to inhabit the site.\r\nCommunity participation was an integral part of the design of this project. Members of the neighborhood around Cataldi Park were invited to emboss the leaves into the cement over a two day period. In doing so, this project hoped to encourage a greater sense of community, a sentiment of shared property, and a feeling of involvement in the process.",

The artwork explores the relationship between art and technology, and celebrates the earth’s basic natural resources as the foundation of technological innovation.\r\nOrigin is comprised of several integral elements. A gilded, nine-foot diameter tower rises 45’ from the lower level’s terrazzo floor. The terrazzo floor design, which can easily be seen from the upper levels and the staircase as one descends, is derived from the pattern of an early integrated circuit. Natural granite boulders placed within the floor space provide informal seating. Upon further exploration the viewer looks up to a suspended tree-root system covered in gold leaf. An elegant spectrum of ever unfolding colored lights play across the interior surfaces of the tower and interact with the suspended gilded root system. This play of light patterns is the result of a solar light sculpture at the roof level which gathers sunlight and projects it through a series of mirrors to an imaging mechanism inside the tower.",

Both the quill and the circle are supported by a 16-foot tapered mast. The quill is mounted on bearings allowing it to rotate in the wind. The structure of both elements is composed of stainless steel tubing.\r\nThe artwork also features text from William Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and reads “We are such stuff as dreams are made on...” This piece celebrates language as a triumph of human ingenuity.

Source material for the photos includes trees, rocks and plants from Overfelt Gardens, as well as Chinese Scholars’ Rocks from some of the preeminent collections in the United States.\r\nIntegrated into the installation at the west end of the building is the signage for the Library’s “Tech Connect” area. This sign is comprised of two parts — the practical wayfinding text, and the surrounding cellular image forms. The cellular pattern was made using Voronoi diagrams for points that are algorithmically distributed through the panel and concentrated within the letter forms. So, abstractly the cells are defined by the letters and the surrounding images themselves. The “Tech Connect” sign was designed by Michael Thompson of Coded Meaning, a frequent collaborator with Ms. Wagner.",

Each piece responds to a particular aspect of the school's physical, social or historical environment.\r\n\r\n    Alphabet Windows: twenty six of the small classroom windows feature an animal or a bird whose name corresponds with one of the letters of the alphabet.\r\n    Animal Footprints: Animal foot prints are impressed into the plaza around the water fountain near the Administrative building.  They are placed in such a way as to appear that the animals have come to drink at the \"watering hole.\"\r\n    Fossil Wall: The wall between the Kindergarten and Multi-use room, presents a geological fossil, a replica of actual an actual fossil.  Students are exposed to the concept of geological time and the fossil record.\r\n    Classroom Name Plaques: Each of the three floors of the school building are given a classification category of Animal, Vegetable or Mineral.  The ground floor is named for rocks and minerals, the second floor for plant life and the third floor for animal life. Each room is given a name as a layer of identity beyond the usual room numbers. The progression upward in the building represents greater complexity of life.  \r\n    Banner Mural: Historic murals from the original school have been documented and photographically reproduced on screen mesh fabric, which is hung as 2' X 5' banners in the mulit-use room.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to celebrate the identity of the school by preserving the past and contributing new identity to inspire the imagination of its student body.",

The umbrella also suggests Padre Sheedy's high aspirations of service and the sense of welcome that he extended towards everyone.\r\nPadre Sheedy's Umbrella was created by San Jose State University art professor Tony May and the students in his Art in Community class in commemoration of Father Mateo Sheedy. The SJSU artists engaged in a thoughtful process of developing the public art to ensure that it would serve as a fitting tribute to Padre Sheedy's vision and legacy.",

From afar, the bench appears to be a sculpture, but upon further exploration, one discovers that it is also a private bench to contemplate the view. The inspiration for the form of the bench is drawn from nature, such as a seed pod or leaf. The spiral designs represents a spirit of renewal and the cycle of life. Thus,  Meditation Bench is intended to connect the sitter to the environment of Groesbeck Hill Park, and the beauty of the natural forms found in nature. This piece reflects the artist’s study of archetypal symbols from nature and ancient art. She considers shapes such the sprial, circle, and cresent a part of a universal visual language. Inspiration for these geometric forms also comes from ancient pottery and cave walls, which the artist has explored extensively. For the artist, Meditation Bench is both a reference to nature and to past artistic forms.",

He recognized that the objects poking out of the ground that day were clearly unusual -- he had discovered the tusks and skeleton of a mammoth. \"Lupe the Mammoth\" was inspired by this discovery.\r\nThe artwork is a technology-driven design with hand-crafted sensibilities. While the actual mammoth was a juvenile and about 8’ tall, the sculpture measures 12.5’ in height and is made of galvanized steel. The artwork was painstakingly fabricated at Paramount Roll & Forming; bent piece by piece and fit into a notched support structure after which it was galvanized for its final finish. The artwork is titled “Lupe,” but has quickly assumed the nickname Lupe the Mammoth as a popular post on social media; #LupeTheMammoth.",

The work is composed of three elements:\r\nLibrary Table\r\nThe surface of the cast-concrete library table is inlaid with bronze farm tools, a cast-bronze field-worker's hat, photo-etched black granite portraits, photo-etched ceramic tiles and bronze text. The relief surface of the table is designed to encourage pedestrians to view and touch the inlaid elements.\r\nCast Bronze Chair\r\nAt the west end of the table, facing Plaza de Cesar Chavez, an empty cast-bronze chair with a wooden seat serves as a metaphor for Dr. Galarza as the field worker who took his scholarly practice into the world. The chair is a functional element, and is intended to encourage visitors to stop, sit and explore the information contained in the table surface.\r\nRibbons of Terrazzo\r\nThe ribbons of terrazzo are 11\" wide and of varying length, and lace through the existing Paseo paving in each of the four blocks. Designed to have a subtle physical and visual impact upon the Paseo, these ribbons are intended to draw the pedestrian through the length of the walkway. The terrazzo is inlaid with bronze text, in both English and Spanish, introducing the commemoration through personal recollections about Dr. Galarza's life and work from his family, friends and colleagues.",

All the elements are based on objects, images and ideas cultivated by the artists from the community.\r\nThe artists engaged in extensive interaction with the Edenvale community in the creation of the artwork. They went out to schools, neighborhood and community gatherings, youth centers and the library to encourage community members to \"Be a Part of the Art\" by contributing objects, stories, photos and memorabilia that represented their own lives.\r\nThe window drawings depict a series of doors, many photographed in the adjacent neighborhood. The doors become an entry point to different ideas the artists wanted to convey, based on the community outreach and their own research. Sculptures are set in boxes that are inset in the façade of the building. The sculptures are hybrids of many of the donated and discovered items from a very diverse community brought together in a way to inspire new thinking about everyday objects, as well as the long and interesting history of the area. The bronzes are accompanied by quotes from A Spiritual Thought for Each Day, a book of inspirational thoughts by Mary Hayes- Chynoweth, an early settler in the Edenvale, and builder of Hayes Mansion.",

      "description": "Olé, a Piece in Two Movements: Aton and Floribunda\r\n\r\n\r\nThe artwork is comprised of two parts: Aton and Floribunda.\r\nAton by definition is the disk of the sun, regarded as a deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. A 5’ diameter aluminum disc frames glass roses that shoot out from the surface like solar flares. Each rose is attached to a pipe stem threaded through hieroglyphic punctures cut in the surface of the disc. The stems continue through the disc and braid into a 12 foot long ‘stream’ trailing through the lobby space. Roses, leaves and thorns adorn this ‘stem stream’.\r\nThe inspiration for Aton is from two sources and the meanings prompted by their overlay are multifaceted. Framed by the disc, the rose may represent passion & friendship (red & yellow), solar flares (blossoms framed by the disc), streams of thought (intertwined stems), problems & challenges (thorns), and, perhaps, as the mystic poet Rumi might ascribe—an inner luminosity essential to the rose itself.\r\nThe second piece of Olé is Floribunda (a popular rose cultivar group) located on fireplace chimney. This element is a metal piece with water jet cut hieroglyphics mounted on the chimney with a stream of glass roses randomly placed from mantle to ceiling. The blown glass and aluminum artwork explores the natural world in the context of the world of knowledge and reason – historic and contemporary.",

Water flows from the Tule Reed Drain into a runnel on top of the Strata Wall, and then cascades onto a splash stone and into the landscape. Like water, light sustains the community from plant growth to the flow of electric energy essential to high tech.

      "description": "Jump Cuts\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movie marquee became a familiar downtown architectural feature with the popularization of cinema in the 1920's and 1930's. Its objective of transmitting information to the street was fully realized at night with illuminated displays as a form of urban seduction.  A contemporary interpretation of the marquee suggests not only technical revision for this transmission of information, but a rethinking of urban communication.\r\nJump Cuts reinterprets the mechanism of the marquee through sculptural, electronic and video elements, broadcasting images and texts, both informational and contemplative, to the street. The artwork transforms the visual accessibility of the lobby by alternating between the actual view from the street and live video views from within, thus flipping the building inside-out and back, electronically.\r\nThe project includes twelve 5' by 6'- 8\" liquid-crystal display panels mounted on the outside of the glass facade of the building. By day, viewers see text permanently etched onto the surface of the glass panels.  From the outside, the text reads, \"Truth is stranger than fiction is stranger than truth...\"  From inside the lobby, the text reads, \"Life imitates art imitates life...\"\r\nIn the evening, the LCD panels  are transformed into video screens.  Images projected onto the screens sequence between movie trailers and live feed from video cameras mounted inside the lobby.  In between these sequences, the screens become transparent, allowing full view of the interior lobby.  A computer controls all of the dynamic elements of the marquee, including activating the panels, turning them translucent and providing the surface upon which images can be projected.  The image sequencing is preprogrammed for the twelve months of the year to begin operation at dusk and continue through midnight.",

These figures range in height from 15 - 18 feet, represent ice dancing, skating and playing hockey, and illustrate the fun and excitement of ice skating. Two of the figures represent enthusiastic spectators. Artist JoeSam stated that this piece is about warmth, color, and humor as seen through these playful figures.",

The canopy is created with six interlocking steel rings intricately held in tension by steel cables, covered by translucent polycarbonates 'leaves.'\r\nCritical to Yang’s concept for the artwork is the gathering of spoken ideas. Adjacent to the Tree is the project’s sculptural sound “booth” (the “Seed”) where a sensor activated, audible prompt, encourages community to leave a short voice message.  Once a day before morning, messages are wirelessly transmitted to sound equipment housed at the center of the canopy (the “Fruit”), where audio messages are reassembled to create the haiku-like whispers within the Tree. Some whispers remain over time; others fall away into an ever-evolving ambient music-like soundscape that the artist describes as a “self-sustaining ecology of ideas",

On the stainless steel columns are etched images of firefighters and historic firefighters from cultures from throughout history: 1) Wildland firefighter, 2) Explorers (youth firefighter program), 3) Vigiles Urbani (the first organized fire brigade of Europe), 4) Knight of Malta (where the current Maltese cross on firefighters emblem originated), 5) Edo Firefighter (early Japanese firefighter) and 6) Sapeurs-Pompiers (the first professional firefighters from the French Army of the 19th century).\r\nEach column is divided into three parts that can be turned individually, like a section of a mix ‘n match puzzle so that the figures can be morphed into any number of combinations.",

The elements include a glass mosaic niche patterned in celestial designs; a bronze apricot branch with glass apricots; a timeline of Mayfair historic images on glass; and a video installation featuring images of local history and culture.

The project elements work together to stimulate community curiosity, encourage participation in best household practices, and promote environmental stewardship:\r\n\r\n    Doorhanger:  Addressing the issue directly at the household, a bold graphic poster is distributed as a door hanger by DOT crews in the vicinity of recent sanitary sewer maintenance activity. The poster features simple and engaging icons to educate about various FOG wastes and common household products not to be put in sinks; the poster also brings awareness to features of the infrastructure system. Printed in the project’s signature electric green color, the door hanger connects to the other art elements described below. Multi-lingual text provides explanation and vocabulary for a more informed community. \r\n    Manhole Marker: Bringing attention to the infrastructure below the streets, manholes of recently serviced sewer lines were painted in the project’s signature electric green color, creating awareness of this largely unnoticed infrastructure. Painting of the manholes coincided with the distribution of door hangers creating a connection from the front door to the system under the street. \r\n    Maintenance Truck Graphic: A bold vinyl graphic was applied to select sewer maintenance trucks traveling to the target neighborhoods that features a design that calls out the 24/7 sewer maintenance service provided by the City. The vinyl graphic will be rendered in the project’s signature electric green color reinforcing the connection between the truck, door hangers and manhole markers and the workforce that is constantly on the move to manage the system.",

Thin metal strips are embedded in the terrazzo curve throughout the rink creating patterns like those etched in ice by skate blades. Complementing these curves, text conveying the personal recollections of each champion swirl about the ice. The surface of the rink also features five recessed niches; these contain display photographs and personal memorabilia of the San Jose area figure skating champions.\r\nThe final element of the work is a set of three winners' circles, cylindrical disks of varying heights; these reference the award podiums for medalists. They are designed so that anyone can stand on them and experience a personal moment of championship.",

According to the artist:\r\n“What unites all people is our search to understand our world and existence. From the moment we are born we begin the process of discovery that continues throughout our lives.  For that reason I have decided to title the sculptures Discoveries.\"\r\nThe concept of the pieces was to suggest the universal human potential for exploration and learning through our senses.The three large white marble stones were found in Carrara, Italy in the same place where Michelangelo sourced stone for his carvings over 500 years ago. The carving of the stones into an ear, mouth, and eye, show the human forms emerging out of the rough hewn boulders. It is a balance of the beauty of the natural stone and the beautiful carving of the human forms.",

      "description": "Enchanted Forest and Almaden Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmaden Valley is a two panel mural that flanks the stage in the community room. The left panel is a representation of the agrarian past of the Almaden Valley. The image depicts a man carrying a bushel basket. In the background is an oak tree symbolizing the eternal quality of the natural world. The right panel depicts a female figure with children dancing around her. She faces the children with her arms stretched upward seeming to hold a transparent sphere. The sphere symbolizes the limitless possibilities of the future. Both panels are painted on a gilt silver background (gold over silver). A limited palette of cinnabar-colored pigment is used. The silver and cinnabar reference the local mercury mines that played an important part in the development of the Almaden area. The mural has a stylistic affinity to the murals created through the federal WPA program in the 1930’s and 40’s. The connection to this rich heritage is important to artists’ vision for the work.\r\nEvans and Brown also created two decorative murals for the Children’s Areas in the Library and Community wings of the building. As its name conveys, Enchanted Forest suggests themes of a whimsical enchanted forest.",

The artwork builds on the idea of age rings in the cross-section of a tree trunk: images in each concentric ring speak to a specific period of history and growth in the region, from the earliest period of indigenous inhabitants to the present.\r\n    Bibliotree is sculptural element in the form of a tall flourishing tree made of water jet cut steel. The cut outs in the trunk are letters from the alphabets of the many languages contained in the Library's collection. On the lower branches of the tree are books and objects associated with reading; these continue onto the higher branches, which also contain objects representing newer forms of media. In this way the work suggests a developmental progression: the roots of language in letters and alphabets flourish into literature and on into other media.\r\n    Orchard Walk, 26 thematic sidewalk insets made of stainless steel and flamed granite, are embedded in the concrete along the walkway that runs between Santa Teresa Blvd. and the Library entrance. The insets each feature the title of a literary, media or music reference, each with a different fruit in the title along with the author’s, director’s or composer’s name and a corresponding fruit image. The titles were drawn from world literature and media as well as items in the Library collection. Orchard Walk also includes a \"welcome mat\" in the main entrance to the Library. It contains whimsical images of two people, male and female, tending a garden and framed in the words \"Cultivate Your Mind in the Orchard of Knowledge,\" the artist’s unifying theme for the group of artworks.",

These dangos are made of thick clay and covered in decorative glazes. When constructing these massive ceramic pieces, Kaneko starts building from the bottom up. He layers slabs of clay to shape the walls allowing the bottom to dry as he builds up to the top. Then he must fire the whole structure in a kiln without cracking or breaking it. Kaneko hopes that his sculptures will spark a dialogue around what he refers to as “spiritual space.” He uses the analogy of comparing a 70 story skyscraper to a 3000 meter high mountain to explain how understanding of scale changes based on environment. The public will observe this relationship between scale and environment when standing next to these grand seven foot tall sculptures.",

The artwork is part of a larger, comprehensive project, the Alum Rock Cultural History Corridor (ARCHC), which seeks to celebrate the rich cultural history of east San Jose through artworks and other elements.\r\nRaps’ sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved ‘tines’ that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow’s curved 'tines', miming the harrow’s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community. The arms in the artwork are castings of real community members, underscoring the artwork’s connection to the area and to this community (see fact sheet for detail). Each person has a real connection to the idea represented in the work.",

Each of the eight free-standing structural columns is composed of a stack of tractor tires; curved staves milled from recycled old-growth redwood, which are evocative of a harvest basket; the stainless steel can that pays homage to the canneries; and madrone branches, an indigenous tree revered by the local Ohlone Indians.\r\nTrachtenberg was also captivated by the intrinsic beauty of the farmed landscape, inspiration which she captured and reflected in the other component of Groundwork: a series of twenty-six paintings called The Shadow Frieze. The paintings that encircle the rotunda below the window openings evoke the aerial views of tilled earth, orchards, and crop rows.",

As one color slowly dims another color is brought up in intensity to fill the volume of space. The elevators themselves have standard incandescent lights and are visible traveling through the volume of color.Centered within the nine foot by six foot bays of the building, behind the perforated metal façade, are 24 three-foot squares of neon light controlled by individual random fading transformers. The rectangular mass created by the 24 boxes illuminates the building façade. The squares of light float, change color, and fade constantly, but subtly, create new patterns and compositions.",

A second pool is at the center of this feature formed by a weir (a small overflow dam used to alter the flow of a river or stream). Water flows over the edge of the weir to a natural pond below decorated  with mud-like imprints of animal tracks, plant impressions, and human marks. A bench made of concrete, sandstone, and granite sits next to the water features and is decorated with the image of ripples in a pool. The steel canopy’s leaf and animal silhouettes cast a dappled light effect on the bench. The ball washer is activated like a drinking fountain. The spiral motion of the golf ball as it is washed acts as a meditative and focusing activity for golfers.",

      "description": "Coatlique Shopping, Tula Sentries, & Mandalas\r\n\r\n\r\nThe San José Public Art Program in association with project developer Blake Hunt Ventures, commissioned Einar and Jamex de la Torre to collaborate with the community in the creation of artwork for the Story & King Development. The artists created three different artworks, positioned in locations throughout the shopping center parking lot and also on the front and side wall of the Target store. The three distinct works make reference to historic Mexican art forms while integrating the artists' distinct and often humorous take on contemporary culture. The de la Torre brothers incorporate time-honored styles such as Mexican folk art and symbols of Catholicism as well as universal subjects such gender roles and cultural integration. As a result, viewers of their work are able to place one foot in the worlds of pre-Columbian Mexico while the other is planted firmly in contemporary society.",

Themes of exploration and discovery are emphasized in a variety of ways, including the creation of a sight line game related to the title of the work. The repeated use of weaving (in representational forms, and in more abstract renderings of roadways and paths) is intended to suggest the complexity and organization of human knowledge. Likewise, the illustration of locally-cultivated fruits in grid patterns refers not only to the agricultural history of orchards near the site, but also to the gathering and categorization of information as it occurs in a library. Pastoral imagery dominates the work, remembering and celebrating ways of life which have largely vanished from the area.",

These unifying motifs allow the viewer to explore a central theme of this artwork: what is the relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom?",

      "description": "Beaver-Splash-Jump-Dog\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fun and exuberant sculpture links the themes of wild animal and domestic dog. A bronze beaver in the creek slaps the water with its tail and creates an over-sized splash of stainless steel.  An extension of the splash sends a bright yellow ball in a high-arcing trajectory ten feet high.  Fifteen feet away, a bronze dog leaps ten feet in the air and in visual time lapse sequence catches the ball, completing the connection between the two sculptural elements and the two worlds.",
