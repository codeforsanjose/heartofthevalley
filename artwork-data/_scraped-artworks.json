      "description": ")\r\n\r\nA native of San Jose, Emma Prusch bequeathed her 47 acre dairy farm to the City in 1962. The deed to the City specified that the City “will make said park a place of relaxation, recreation, and enjoyment for the people of the City of San Jose, and in such a manner as will, to extent that such can be reasonably done, give to said park a rural county character and atmosphere.” Emma Prusch Farm Park includes heritage, high density, and rare fruit orchards, a Plant Science Center, two community gardens, pollinator and butterfly gardens, as well as acres of lush green lawns for picnics and playing. It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine.\r\nThe artist was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San Jose's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. A Monument to the Last Barn draws upon this influence: the form is a four-sided metal structure derived from traditional Santa Clara barns, but stripped of outer cladding to reveal the essential framework. This iconic linkage to early barns is further underscored by the rich, deep barn red color of the piece. The barn’s corrugated galvanized steel roof is topped with three golden wind vanes depicting a rooster, a windmill and an apple. The gables and railings are inset with filigree screens in a bold “fruits and leaves” pattern, representing the orchards that were so vital to the region. Benches placed inside the barn create an inviting and reflective atmosphere amidst the lively park grounds. The artist conceived of this work as homage to the last great large barn on the site at Prusch Farm Park.\r\nDistrict: 5\r\nReport a Concern:  (408) 793-04330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov.\r\nDocuments\t\r\n\r\n    A Monument to the Last Barn - Fact Sheet\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n    (Public Art) Historic Commemorations & Memorials\r\n    (Public Art) Parks & Trails\r\n    (Public Art) Permanent Artworks",

She drove in search of it and found the strip of trees alongside the IBM campus on Cottle Road and photographed the trees. When, in the following months Filo's thoughts kept returning to the trees, she decided to document the orchard before it was destroyed. It was then she set out to make an individual portrait of each of the orchard’s 1,737 trees with the intention of arranging the finished photographs in the same grid in which the trees were planted in the orchard.\r\nBy this time IBM, which had preserved the orchard on its property for decades, had sold the land, and a large billboard announced that the 42 acres were up for sale again. Filo worked over the next three years, choosing to photograph the trees’ leafless branches in winter under overcast skies. With the orchard still standing, but the land slated for development, she photographed the final tree in 2006.\r\nDistrict: 3\r\nReport a Concern: (408) 793-4330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov.\r\nDocuments\r\n\r\n    1737 Trees - Fact Sheet\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n    (Public Art) City Hall\r\n    (Public Art) Downtown\r\n    (Public Art) Historic Commemorations & Memorials\r\n    (Public Art) Permanent Artworks",

The artwork 8 Minutes approaches the topic of the 8-minute response in three ways:\r\n\r\n    A visual measurement of 8 minutes,\r\n    A conveyor of Fire Station 24th continuous efforts on behalf of the community, and\r\n    Connecting the community to the station via the eight minute duration.\r\n\r\nAll the elements complement each other to create a rich understanding of time in the context of Fire Station 24.\r\nThe first element is the LED Countdown Timer placed over the apparatus bay. The timer is connected to the fire pager system; when a response call is received it automatically starts an 8-minute counter that travels as a light across the sign. After the 8-minute light completes its travel across the sign, the \"call time\" is added to a list of the 8 most recent call times displayed on the sign. The second and third components of the artwork are a series of tiles in the fire station entryway. One set of tiles is a compilation of text about the number 8 and 8-minute duration. For example: “A fallen or lying down 8 is used to represent infinity in mathematics.” The third component is a series of 8-minute time-lapsed community photographs that depict every day activities to the same time frame of the recommended standard response time – to provide visitors to the station a visceral sense of the anxiety-filled 8 minutes awaiting emergency response versus the same 8-minutes washing a car, skateboarding or barbecuing. \r\nDistrict: 8\r\nReport a Concern: (408) 793-4330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov.\r\nDocuments\r\n\r\n    8 Minutes (Fire Station 24) - Fact Sheet\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n    (Public Art) Permanent Artworks\r\n    (Public Art) Public Safety - Police & Fire Stations",

Themes of exploration and discovery are emphasized in a variety of ways, including the creation of a sight line game related to the title of the work. The repeated use of weaving (in representational forms, and in more abstract renderings of roadways and paths) is intended to suggest the complexity and organization of human knowledge. Likewise, the illustration of locally-cultivated fruits in grid patterns refers not only to the agricultural history of orchards near the site, but also to the gathering and categorization of information as it occurs in a library. Pastoral imagery dominates the work, remembering and celebrating ways of life which have largely vanished from the area. \r\nDistrict: 9\r\nReport a Concern: (408) 793-4330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov.\r\nDocuments\r\n\r\n    Cambrian BeeLine - Fact Sheet\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n    (Public Art) Libraries\r\n    (Public Art) Permanent Artworks",
