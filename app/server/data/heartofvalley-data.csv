Their portraits rest on either side of the ceramic milagro heart, created by various clay artists from Higher Fire, which encompasses the young donor’s personalities through visual images and symbols. At the center of this artwork, a hummingbird hovers in front of a marigold flower, which has been used in Aztec culture to signify the passing of a loved one. The significance of the hummingbird stems from both Mayan and Aztec folklore. This small and colorful bird represents rebirth and mobility. The hummingbird is able to move in all seven directions, up, down, left, right, forward, backward, and hover.
