1737 Trees,Photography,San José City Hall,,Angela Buenning Filo,http://www.angelabuenning.com/,City of San Jose,"Trees is a grid of photographic portraits of every tree in one of San Jose’s last orchards. Angela Buenning Filo was inspired to photograph these trees by a November 10th, 2002 newspaper article that described a San Jose prune orchard as the last in Silicon Valley. She drove in search of it and found the strip of trees alongside the IBM campus on Cottle Road and photographed the trees. When, in the following months Filo's thoughts kept returning to the trees, she decided to document the orchard before it was destroyed. It was then she set out to make an individual portrait of each of the orchard’s 1,737 trees with the intention of arranging the finished photographs in the same grid in which the trees were planted in the orchard. By this time IBM, which had preserved the orchard on its property for decades, had sold the land, and a large billboard announced that the 42 acres were up for sale again. Filo worked over the next three years, choosing to photograph the trees’ leafless branches in winter under overcast skies. With the orchard still standing, but the land slated for development, she photographed the final tree in 2006.",200 E.

A Monument to the Last Barn,Architecture,Emma Prusch Farm Park,,Gloria Bornstein,,City of San Jose,"A native of San Jose, Emma Prusch bequeathed her 47 acre dairy farm to the City in 1962. The deed to the City specified that the City “will make said park a place of relaxation, recreation, and enjoyment for the people of the City of San Jose, and in such a manner as will, to extent that such can be  reasonably done, give to said park a rural county character and atmosphere.” Emma Prusch Farm Park includes heritage, high density, and rare fruit orchards, a Plant Science Center, two community gardens, pollinator and butterfly gardens, as well as acres of lush green lawns for picnics and playing. It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine. 

The artist was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San Jose's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. A Monument to the Last Barn draws upon this influence: the form is a four-sided metal structure derived from traditional Santa Clara barns, but stripped of outer cladding to reveal the essential framework. This iconic linkage to early barns is further underscored by the rich, deep barn red color of the piece. The barn’s corrugated galvanized steel roof is topped with three golden wind vanes depicting a rooster, a windmill and an apple. The gables and railings are inset with filigree screens in a bold “fruits and leaves” pattern, representing the orchards that were so vital to the region. Benches placed inside the barn create an inviting and reflective atmosphere amidst the lively park grounds. The artist conceived of this work as homage to the last great large barn on the site at Prusch Farm Park.",647 S.

Convergence,Sculpture,San Jose Repertory Theater,,Jun Kaneko,https://www.junkaneko.com/,City of San Jose,"The artist, Jun Kaneko, calls these curvilinear ceramic pieces “dangos,” meaning dumplings in Japanese. These dangos are made of thick clay and covered in decorative glazes. When constructing these massive ceramic pieces, Kaneko starts building from the bottom up. He layers slabs of clay to shape the walls allowing the bottom to dry as he builds up to the top. Then he must fire the whole structure in a kiln without cracking or breaking it. Kaneko hopes that his sculptures will spark a dialogue around what he refers to as “spiritual space.” He uses the analogy of comparing a 70 story skyscraper to a 3000 meter high mountain to explain how understanding of scale changes based on environment.

Corriente de Agua,Sculpture,Los Lagos Golf Course,,Michael Davis,https://www.mad-art.com/,City of San Jose,"The Los Lagos Golf Course is an eighteen-hole course located along fourteen miles of the Coyote Creek. Corriente de Agua (Water Current) is intended as a transitional piece between landscapes and recalls the history of the Coyote Creek. The installation is comprised of several parts including three water features, a covered seating area, and a unique golf ball washer.  Water from the creek flows into a series of water features starting with a circular pool in which water continuously drips from a bamboo pipe disturbing the tranquil surface of the water. A second pool is at the center of this feature formed by a weir (a small overflow dam used to alter the flow of a river or stream). Water flows over the edge of the weir to a natural pond below decorated  with mud-like imprints of animal tracks, plant impressions, and human marks.  A bench made of concrete, sandstone, and granite sits next to the water features and is decorated with the image of ripples in a pool. The steel canopy’s leaf and animal silhouettes cast a dappled light effect on the bench.  The ball washer is activated like a drinking fountain.

Cultivate Your Mind in the Orchard of Knowledge,"Architecture, Sculpture",Santa Teresa Branch Library,,Beatrice Coron,https://www.beatricecoron.com/,City of San Jose,"The artwork consists of three separate artwork: The Tree of Knowledge includes three glass panes in the window wall that runs the length of the Library's main lobby. The artwork builds on the idea of age rings in the cross-section of a tree trunk: images in each concentric ring speak to a specific period of history and growth in the region, from the earliest period of indigenous inhabitants to the present. Bibliotree is sculptural element in the form of a tall flourishing tree made of water jet cut steel. The cut outs in the trunk are letters from the alphabets of the many languages contained in the Library's collection. On the lower branches of the tree are books and objects associated with reading; these continue onto the higher branches, which also contain objects representing newer forms of media. In this way the work suggests a developmental progression: the roots of language in letters and alphabets flourish into literature and on into other media. Orchard Walk, 26 thematic sidewalk insets made of stainless steel and flamed granite, are embedded in the concrete along the walkway that runs between Santa Teresa Blvd. and the Library entrance. The insets each feature the title of a literary, media or music reference, each with a different fruit in the title along with the author’s, director’s or composer’s name and a corresponding fruit image. The titles were drawn from world literature and media as well as items in the Library collection. Orchard Walk also includes a ""welcome mat"" in the main entrance to the Library.

The artwork is part of a larger, comprehensive project, the Alum Rock Cultural History Corridor (ARCHC), which seeks to celebrate the rich cultural history of east San Jose through artworks and other elements. Raps’ sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved ‘tines’ that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow’s curved 'tines', miming the harrow’s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community.

The project elements work together to stimulate community curiosity, encourage participation in best household practices, and promote environmental stewardship:Doorhanger:  Addressing the issue directly at the household, a bold graphic poster is distributed as a door hanger by DOT crews in the vicinity of recent sanitary sewer maintenance activity. The poster features simple and engaging icons to educate about various FOG wastes and common household products not to be put in sinks; the poster also brings awareness to features of the infrastructure system. Printed in the project’s signature electric green color, the door hanger connects to the other art elements described below. Multi-lingual text provides explanation and vocabulary for a more informed community. Manhole Marker: Bringing attention to the infrastructure below the streets, manholes of recently serviced sewer lines were painted in the project’s signature electric green color, creating awareness of this largely unnoticed infrastructure. Painting of the manholes coincided with the distribution of door hangers creating a connection from the front door to the system under the street. Maintenance Truck Graphic: A bold vinyl graphic was applied to select sewer maintenance trucks traveling to the target neighborhoods that features a design that calls out the 24/7 sewer maintenance service provided by the City. The vinyl graphic will be rendered in the project’s signature electric green color reinforcing the connection between the truck, door hangers and manhole markers and the workforce that is constantly on the move to manage the system.

Idea Tree,Sculpture,San Jose McEnery Convention Center,,Soo-in Yang,http://lifethings.in/?ckattempt=2,City of San Jose,"Creating a social space bringing together Convention Center event goers and the general public, the project’s central element is a 40’ diameter canopy, supported by three groups of columns. The canopy is created with six interlocking steel rings intricately held in tension by steel cables, covered by translucent polycarbonates 'leaves.'Critical to Yang’s concept for the artwork is the gathering of spoken ideas. Adjacent to the Tree is the project’s sculptural sound “booth” (the “Seed”) where a sensor activated, audible prompt, encourages community to leave a short voice message.  Once a day before morning, messages are wirelessly transmitted to sound equipment housed at the center of the canopy (the “Fruit”), where audio messages are reassembled to create the haiku-like whispers within the Tree. Some whispers remain over time; others fall away into an ever-evolving ambient music-like soundscape that the artist describes as a “self-sustaining ecology of ideas",150 W San Carlos St,San Jose,CA,95113,City of San Jose,https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showdocument?id=32363,"-121.889178504024,

Jump Cuts,"Interactive, Sculpture ",Camera Cineplex,,Diller + Scofidio with Paul Lewis,https://dsrny.com/,City of San Jose,"The movie marquee became a familiar downtown architectural feature with the popularization of cinema in the 1920's and 1930's. Its objective of transmitting information to the street was fully realized at night with illuminated displays as a form of urban seduction. A contemporary interpretation of the marquee suggests not only technical revision for this transmission of information, but a rethinking of urban communication. Jump Cuts reinterprets the mechanism of the marquee through sculptural, electronic and video elements, broadcasting images and texts, both informational and contemplative, to the street. The artwork transforms the visual accessibility of the lobby by alternating between the actual view from the street and live video views from within, thus flipping the building inside-out and back, electronically. The project includes twelve 5' by 6'- 8"" liquid-crystal display panels mounted on the outside of the glass facade of the building. By day, viewers see text permanently etched onto the surface of the glass panels. From the outside, the text reads, ""Truth is stranger than fiction is stranger than truth..."" From inside the lobby, the text reads, ""Life imitates art imitates life..."" In the evening, the LCD panels are transformed into video screens. Images projected onto the screens sequence between movie trailers and live feed from video cameras mounted inside the lobby. In between these sequences, the screens become transparent, allowing full view of the interior lobby. A computer controls all of the dynamic elements of the marquee, including activating the panels, turning them translucent and providing the surface upon which images can be projected.

Lightlines and Wall of Birds In Flight,Sculpture,East San Jose Carnegie Branch Library,,Joyce Cutler Shaw,,City of San Jose,"East San Jose Carnegie Branch Library features two public art elements by Joyce Cutler Shaw. Lightlines, a sculpture fabricated from aluminum coils, is suspended from the building's ceiling trusses in and around the main entrance and along the full length of the east/west hallway.

She identified imagery that speaks to this area and location, out of which she created a visual vocabulary she calls the East San Jose Carnegie Calligraphy. From this imagery she created laser cut, iridescent acrylic figurative elements that are suspended from the aluminum coils of Lightlines; these animate the artwork with reflective light. Wall of Birds in Flight is an installation on the Library's west wall in the children's area.

Lupe the Mammoth was inspired by this discovery. The artwork is a technology-driven design with hand-crafted sensibilities. While the actual mammoth was a juvenile and about 8’ tall, the sculpture measures 12.5’ in height and is made of galvanized steel.

The stems continue through the disc and braid into a 12 foot long ‘stream’ trailing through the lobby space. Roses, leaves and thorns adorn this ‘stem stream’.

Framed by the disc, the rose may represent passion & friendship (red & yellow), solar flares (blossoms framed by the disc), streams of thought (intertwined stems), problems & challenges (thorns), and, perhaps, as the mystic poet Rumi might ascribe—an inner luminosity essential to the rose itself.

Show Your Stripes,"Architecture, Interactive",The 88,,Jim Conti,,City of San Jose,"Show Your Stripes follows the artist’s interest in the use of patterns. The phrase “show your stripes” has long been used to indicate social or political position; show what you’re made of, which side are you on. At one point in history, stripes were relegated to the margins of society: jugglers, courtesans, and in Medieval paintings the devil is often shown wearing stripes. Over time, stripes have taken on a more positive connotation: freedom, playfulness, or with banker’s pinstripes – taste and status. The artwork is not simply a light show. For the changes to be activated, it takes viewer participation, as the activation phone number above indicates. A quiet reflector of the changing sky during the day, at night the piece transforms into San Jose’s shared secret – the phone number a pass code to control the changing patterns. In 2015, launching the first of a series of light-based artworks that will appear throughout downtown San José as part of the “Illuminating Downtown Project,” the artist was invited to develop a new series of interactive programs based on community input. After completing a simple and fun survey, the Mr. Conti choreographed a sequence of unique stripes based on participants’ answers.  Some number sequences relate to a community member’s favorite song or color, others are simply employed for their dynamism or beauty.

Teaching Stones,Sculpture,Almaden Community Center and Library,,Academy of Art University Graduate Students under the direction of Professor Donna Schumacher,,City of San Jose,"Teaching Stones is a tribute to Doris Dillon, a beloved teacher and community member. Doris Dillon was known for her generous spirit and passion for teaching.  She engaged students through games, and it was often said that she could “teach a rock to read.”  Teaching Stones consists of two primary elements. The first is a reading/sitting area, inspired by one of Doris’ favorite activities: story telling. The reading area provides a place to sit and share stories in the traditional manner of gathering in a circle. The decomposed granite interior of the circle extends outward to the sidewalk forming the overall shape of a keyhole, a reflection of Doris’ belief that reading is a key to learning and knowledge, which she shared through teaching.The second element is a series of nine large smooth-surfaced granite stones that are placed throughout the Liquid Amber Tree grove where the project is sited.  Each stone is inscribed with a ribbon containing words from one of the elements of language: nouns, verbs, etc. The words chosen and sandblasted into the stones were collected inspired by Doris Dillon’s life and work. In the same spirit in which Doris fostered learning through play, the stones can serve as a playful learning tool for future generations: rubbings can be done on the stones with pencil and paper, with students moving from stone to stone, gathering a noun from one, a verb from another and onward until a full sentence is collected.This commemorative artwork honors Doris Dillon’s legacy of mixing learning with pleasure in the form of a gift to the community she loved so well.",6445 Camden Ave.,San Jose,CA,95120,City of San Jose,https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showdocument?id=32449,"-121.865548826801,

Supporters of the artwork believed that it commemorated an important historical event in San Jose's history.  Opponents of the statue responded that it represented a troubling moment in American history, when the United States used the Mexican -American War as a reason to annex California from Mexico. To address the issues arising from the controversy, the City appointed a Historic Art Advisory Committee.     The committee recommended that the City's public art must represent all perspectives of the City's history.  Four additional projects were recommended - artworks commemorating the Ohlone Way of Life, the life of Dr. Ernesto Galarza, the Founding of the Pueblo, and the Agricultural History of the Valley.

Untitled (Mexican Heritage School of Arts and Culture),Architecture,Mexican Heritage Plaza,,Anne Chamberlain and Victor Maria Zaballa,,City of San Jose,"The main theme of the artwork is Cemanahuac: the location of the individual within his/her community as well as within the cosmos. According to Mesoamerican indigenous cultures and oral traditions, each of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) corresponds to an element, a community memory of value, a time of day, and a color of corn  a fundamental agricultural symbol:  

• East is fire, family, sunrise, and red corn
• West is wind, local heroes, sunset, and yellow corn
• South is earth, work, noon, and blue corn
• North is water, history, night, and white corn 

These symbols honor the Mexican community in various forms throughout the plaza: 

• Four patterned metal grilles in the windows of the tower introduce traditional ironwork with pre-Columbian designs.  
• Metal work is continued in each of the gates into the plaza.  
• Mosaic thresholds inside the gates explore the theme of location and direction. The thresholds were inspired by mosaics commonly seen in Mexican colonial cities such as Taxco, Puebla and Tlaxcala and mosaic work in San Jose. 

The garden alcoves are offering places linked by thematic press tiles to the cardinal directions and dedicated to a community value. The tiles were created by community members during a series of public workshops. The photographic tiles were translated from family albums and personal collections contributed by the local community.   

A recurring image of the hummingbird, derived from Mesoamerican motifs, can be seen at the water fountain and on two accent walls at the south and east entrances. The hummingbird, an ancient Mesoamerican talisman, is a symbol of love and the warrior spirit. It is common in San Jose, a tiny but tenacious bird that migrates thousands of miles from Mexico to California every year and plays a role in shaping the landscape by pollinating the plants from which it drinks nectar. The hummingbird motif is intended to speak to the spirit of immigrant citizens, their endurance, strength, tenacity, and their contributions to the culture and nature of California.

Waterscape,Sculpture,San José City Hall (Plaza),,Anna Valentina Murch and Doug Hollis,,City of San Jose,"Waterscape Artists: Anna Valentina Murch and Doug Hollis

This water sculpture was inspired by the natural geological and artesian conditions underlying the San Jose region. The specific design of Waterscape is composed of two topographic fields of monumental granite slabs. The fields slope from Santa Clara Street toward the City Hall plaza allowing the water to flow down the surface of the fields onto the plaza in subtle ripples. Water also flows over the vertical stone on the fountain edges, disappearing beneath the plaza, creating walls of water that define the perimeter along Santa Clara Street. The water within the field is programmed to respond to changes in time of day, temperature, season and availability of water to create different visual, sonic and atmospheric qualities. The piece is illuminated at night for a distinctive evening identity.",200 E.

Where the Tree is Born,Sculpture,Joyce Ellington Branch Library,,Masayuki Nagase,http://www.mnagase.com/,City of San Jose,"Mr. Nagase describes his concept of a tree as metaphor for the body and soul of the earliest inhabitants. Trees encompass an iconic role in community life. Throughout time trees have served as gathering places, and learning takes place beneath their branches. Such trees become part of a community’s sense of self and even when they disappear, they remain in the community’s collective sense of place. These ideas inspired this 6’ diameter granite seating element. Handprints on the side of the tree were collected from local community members and children at the Grant Elementary School, and in the center is an abbreviated history of the site – echoing the role rings play in marking the age of a tree. Incised in the ground are “shadows” of branches overhead.",491 E. Empire St.,San Jose,CA,95112,City of San Jose,https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showdocument?id=32473,"-121.886613499354,

One of the repeated elements in the series, the dragonfly, is considered to be one of the most ancient species that survived from the Jurassic period. The dragonfly references the element of water, as well as the health of the river and its ecological systems. The sculptural insects are of various sizes, heights and locations attached to posts on ball bearings that allow the sculptures to move with the wind. Sunlight creates additional interest by casting shadows through the laser cut wings and reflections off the colorful glass eyes.  The sculptures are intended to reawaken the relationship to the wind, sun, and water, fundamental elements of nature in this urban park. The sculptures also celebrate the Guadalupe River that gives life to flora and fauna and people of San Jose.",San Fernando St. at Almaden,San Jose,CA,95113,City of San Jose,https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showdocument?id=32475,"  -121.8935091,

8 Minutes,Photography,Fire Station 24,,Merge Conceptual Design (Franka Diehnelt and Claudia Reisenberger),https://mergeconceptualdesign.com/,City of San Jose,"The National Fire Protection Association recommends a target of 8 minutes as “standard response time” for emergency calls. The artwork 8 Minutes approaches the topic of the 8-minute response in three ways:

1. A visual measurement of 8 minutes, 
2. A conveyor of Fire Station 24th continuous efforts on behalf of the community, and 
3. Connecting the community to the station via the eight minute duration. All the elements complement each other to create a rich understanding of time in the context of Fire Station 24. 

The first element is the LED Countdown Timer placed over the apparatus bay. The timer is connected to the fire pager system; when a response call is received it automatically starts an 8-minute counter that travels as a light across the sign. After the 8-minute light completes its travel across the sign, the ""call time"" is added to a list of the 8 most recent call times displayed on the sign. The second and third components of the artwork are a series of tiles in the fire station entryway. One set of tiles is a compilation of text about the number 8 and 8-minute duration. For example: “A fallen or lying down 8 is used to represent infinity in mathematics.” The third component is a series of 8-minute time-lapsed community photographs that depict every day activities to the same time frame of the recommended standard response time – to provide visitors to the station a visceral sense of the anxiety-filled 8 minutes awaiting emergency response versus the same 8-minutes washing a car, skateboarding or barbecuing.",1924 Yerba Buena Road,San Jose,CA,95121,City of San Jose,https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/32283/636714227038570000 ," -121.801459182274,
