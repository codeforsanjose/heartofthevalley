    content:
      'Inspired by the growing number of vibrant local public artwork, Yan-Yin Choy, a technology enthusiast with Code for San Jose, wanted to build a community through an interactive public art map. Yan-Yin and Juan Carlos -  owner of Empire Seven Studios, a local art studio located in Japan town - brainstormed ideas for the map, and Juan Carlos came up with the name Heart of the Valley. The map project began! A small dedicated team launched the first version of the website with search capabilities and an interactive map of local art using static data from the City of San Jose. The latest iteration was launched with a new team to add additional capabilities to the website with a revamped contemporary look and feel, with the goal to increase engagement, and expand the scope of showcased art to other cities in the Bay Area. The team also partnered with multiple sources across the Bay Area to collate up to date information about local art and create a searchable catalog for art lovers and enthusiasts.',
