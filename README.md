# Heart of the Valley
There are so many incredible murals and public art in San José, California. This data visualization map is to help community members find public art and murals. 

This project came out of a discussion with community members and [Empire Seven Studios](https://www.empiresevenstudios.com/), a local art studio located in Japantown,  San José, California. For the initial version of the map, Yan-Yin Choy researched local public art and murals from online sources, Instagram, and Facebook. Images are either linked from the online sources; all downloaded images in the ```Img``` folder include sources in the name of the file. The data is updated as of October 1, 2017. 

## Technologies:
- Mapbox GL JS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS

I need help with the following: 
## TODO:
- Data needs to be expanded to include all new murals and public art installed/created in San José, California since October 2017.
- Add private token
- Add about page 
- Add footer
- Create API
- Create user accounts so community members can suggest changes or add a suggested mural/public art
- Allow the art to be filted by proximity, by artist, etc
- CMS admin backend
