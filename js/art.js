          "A native of San José, Emma Prusch bequeathed her 47 acre dairy farm to the City in 1962. The deed to the City specified that the City “will make said park a place of relaxation, recreation, and enjoyment for the people of the City of San José, and in such a manner as will, to extent that such can be reasonably done, give to said park a rural county character and atmosphere.” <br/><br/> Emma Prusch Farm Park includes heritage, high density, and rare fruit orchards, a Plant Science Center, two community gardens, pollinator and butterfly gardens, as well as acres of lush green lawns for picnics and playing. It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine. <br/><br/> In 2006, Gloria Bornstein was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San José's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. <br/><br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-A-Monument-to-the-Last-Barn-E-442",

          'The artist, Jun Kaneko, calls these curvilinear ceramic pieces “dangos,” meaning dumplings in Japanese. These dangos are made of thick clay and covered in decorative glazes. When constructing these massive ceramic pieces, Kaneko starts building from the bottom up. He layers slabs of clay to shape the walls allowing the bottom to dry as he builds up to the top. Then he must fire the whole structure in a kiln without cracking or breaking it. Kaneko hopes that his sculptures will spark a dialogue around what he refers to as “spiritual space.” He uses the analogy of comparing a 70 story skyscraper to a 3000 meter high mountain to explain how understanding of scale changes based on environment. The public will observe this relationship between scale and environment when standing next to these grand seven foot tall sculptures.',

          'The artwork is comprised of two parts: Aton and Floribunda. Aton by definition is the disk of the sun, regarded as a deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. A 5’ diameter aluminum disc frames glass roses that shoot out from the surface like solar flares. Each rose is attached to a pipe stem threaded through hieroglyphic punctures cut in the surface of the disc. The stems continue through the disc and braid into a 12 foot long ‘stream’ trailing through the lobby space. Roses, leaves and thorns adorn this ‘stem stream’. The inspiration for Aton is from two sources and the meanings prompted by their overlay are multifaceted. Framed by the disc, the rose may represent passion & friendship (red & yellow), solar flares (blossoms framed by the disc), streams of thought (intertwined stems), problems & challenges (thorns), and, perhaps, as the mystic poet Rumi might ascribe—an inner luminosity essential to the rose itself. The second piece of Olé is Floribunda (a popular rose cultivar group) located on fireplace chimney. This element is a metal piece with water jet cut hieroglyphics mounted on the chimney with a stream of glass roses randomly placed from mantle to ceiling. The blown glass and aluminum artwork explores the natural world in the context of the world of knowledge and reason – historic and contemporary.',

          'Wind in the Willows, created by Oakland artist David Ruth, is a group of 54 handcrafted and unique art glass windows that vary in size from 6" to 27" square and are installed in an asymmetrical pattern across the west wall of the library. Ruth\'s windows are intended to capture the feeling of light as it filters through tree branches, particularly through willow tree branches. The windows are a striking feature viewed from either the interior or exterior. During the afternoon they create colorful patterns reminiscent of light through leaves on the inside of the library; while in the evening, light from the library emanates outward through the windows.',

          'Teaching Stones is a tribute to Doris Dillon, a beloved teacher and community member. Doris Dillon was known for her generous spirit and passion for teaching.  She engaged students through games, and it was often said that she could “teach a rock to read.”  Teaching Stones consists of two primary elements. The first is a reading/sitting area, inspired by one of Doris’ favorite activities: story telling. The reading area provides a place to sit and share stories in the traditional manner of gathering in a circle. The decomposed granite interior of the circle extends outward to the sidewalk forming the overall shape of a keyhole, a reflection of Doris’ belief that reading is a key to learning and knowledge, which she shared through teaching.The second element is a series of nine large smooth-surfaced granite stones that are placed throughout the Liquid Amber Tree grove where the project is sited.  Each stone is inscribed with a ribbon containing words from one of the elements of language: nouns, verbs, etc. The words chosen and sandblasted into the stones were collected inspired by Doris Dillon’s life and work. In the same spirit in which Doris fostered learning through play, the stones can serve as a playful learning tool for future generations: rubbings can be done on the stones with pencil and paper, with students moving from stone to stone, gathering a noun from one, a verb from another and onward until a full sentence is collected.This commemorative artwork honors Doris Dillon’s legacy of mixing learning with pleasure in the form of a gift to the community she loved so well.',

On each of its four sides are figurative images that depict a man, woman, elderly woman and child carved in negative relief.  The sculpture is gently animated by a sound element created by the interplay between recorded voices and electronic data related to the library. A data stream, such as the traffic of people in and out of the library throughout the day, the library’s collection, or circulation of library materials, will utilize specially-designed software to interface with vocal tones to create unique musical patterns, generating a “sound portrait” of the library. The sound of this will softly emanate from the granite sculpture, audible when one is nearby.',

She drove in search of it and found the strip of trees alongside the IBM campus on Cottle Road and photographed the trees. When, in the following months Filo's thoughts kept returning to the trees, she decided to document the orchard before it was destroyed. It was then she set out to make an individual portrait of each of the orchard’s 1,737 trees with the intention of arranging the finished photographs in the same grid in which the trees were planted in the orchard. \r\n\r\nBy this time IBM, which had preserved the orchard on its property for decades, had sold the land, and a large billboard announced that the 42 acres were up for sale again. Filo worked over the next three years, choosing to photograph the trees’ leafless branches in winter under overcast skies. With the orchard still standing, but the land slated for development, she photographed the final tree in 2006.",

          'The National Fire Protection Association recommends a target of 8 minutes as “standard response time” for emergency calls. The artwork 8 Minutes approaches the topic of the 8-minute response in three ways:\r\n\r\n1. A visual measurement of 8 minutes,\r\n2. A conveyor of Fire Station 24th continuous efforts on behalf of the community, and\r\n3. Connecting the community to the station via the eight minute duration.\r\n\r\nAll the elements complement each other to create a rich understanding of time in the context of Fire Station 24.\r\n\r\nThe first element is the LED Countdown Timer placed over the apparatus bay. The timer is connected to the fire pager system; when a response call is received it automatically starts an 8-minute counter that travels as a light across the sign. After the 8-minute light completes its travel across the sign, the "call time" is added to a list of the 8 most recent call times displayed on the sign. The second and third components of the artwork are a series of tiles in the fire station entryway. One set of tiles is a compilation of text about the number 8 and 8-minute duration. For example: “A fallen or lying down 8 is used to represent infinity in mathematics.” The third component is a series of 8-minute time-lapsed community photographs that depict every day activities to the same time frame of the recommended standard response time – to provide visitors to the station a visceral sense of the anxiety-filled 8 minutes awaiting emergency response versus the same 8-minutes washing a car, skateboarding or barbecuing.',

Spiritual Stonehenge is a vinyl mural on the ground floor that creates a vibrant field of color as it wraps around the Center’s juice bar, extending into the community room. Mural work is included on the juice bar’s sliding door so that the mural’s appearance changes depending on the position of that door. Spiritual Stonehenge continues to the outside of the building on the north entrance, providing colorful backdrop to Jackie Brookner’s exterior public art. Martinez’s untitled chromed and painted steel sculpture is in the 2nd floor art room. The artist intends for the imagery in the artwork to suggest elements of the history of the park, the area, and the street culture of the area’s youth so that it might function as a new type of urban folk art.',

Each of the 21 water-jet cut stainless steel panels is unique with 74 unique cast glass and bronze sculptures, some with gold leaf, mounted along its length.  The narrative elements within the length of the artwork are drawn from the natural and social histories of the site. Themes of exploration and discovery are emphasized in a variety of ways, including the creation of a sight line game related to the title of the work. The repeated use of weaving (in representational forms, and in more abstract renderings of roadways and paths) is intended to suggest the complexity and organization of human knowledge. Likewise, the illustration of locally-cultivated fruits in grid patterns refers not only to the agricultural history of orchards near the site, but also to the gathering and categorization of information as it occurs in a library. Pastoral imagery dominates the work, remembering and celebrating ways of life which have largely vanished from the area.",

Throughout time trees have served as gathering places, and learning takes place beneath their branches. Such trees become part of a community’s sense of self and even when they disappear, they remain in the community’s collective sense of place. These ideas inspired this 6’ diameter granite seating element. Handprints on the side of the tree were collected from local community members and children at the Grant Elementary School, and in the center is an abbreviated history of the site – echoing the role rings play in marking the age of a tree.

          "The San José Public Art Program in association with Adobe Systems, commissioned artist Ben Rubin in the creation of artwork for Adobe's Amaden Tower.  Not unlike the Semaphore Telegraphs of the 18th century,each wheel of the San José Semaphore can assume four distinct positions and together, the four wheels have a vocabulary of 256 possible combinations that turn into new positions every 7.2 seconds pulsing out a coded message, the content of which is a mystery left as a challenge for the viewers to decipher. As of October 2012, a new code is being displayed; cracking the encryption technique and deciphering the message is posed as a challenge for the public. To the first person or group to successfully crack the new code, Adobe will award bragging rights and acknowledgment on both the Adobe website and the San José Semaphore website.Adobe's Almaden Tower is situated directly beneath the flight path for aircraft landing at the Mineta San José International Airport, and the San José Semaphore is sensitive to the passage of aircraft above it. When a plane flies overhead, the wheels react visibly to the disturbance, and its steady rhythm is broken. After the plane has passed, the disks resume their steady, purposeful transmission. San José Semaphore functions as a beacon in the San José skyline. It is a large and beautiful machine for communication, a slow-motion magnifier for digital communications. Unlike digital transmissions that pass invisibly through the air and through microscopic circuitry, the San José Semaphore’s communication efforts are visible for all to see.",

          'Almaden Valley is a two panel mural that flanks the stage in the community room. The left panel is a representation of the agrarian past of the Almaden Valley. The image depicts a man carrying a bushel basket. In the background is an oak tree symbolizing the eternal quality of the natural world. The right panel depicts a female figure with children dancing around her. She faces the children with her arms stretched upward seeming to hold a transparent sphere. The sphere symbolizes the limitless possibilities of the future.   Both panels are painted on a gilt silver background (gold over silver). A limited palette of cinnabar-colored pigment is used. The silver and cinnabar reference the local mercury mines that played an important part in the development of the Almaden area. The mural has a stylistic affinity to the murals created through the federal WPA program in the 1930’s and 40’s. The connection to this rich heritage is important to artists’ vision for the work.  Evans and Brown also created two decorative murals for the Children’s Areas in the Library and Community wings of the building. As its name conveys, Enchanted Forest suggests themes of a whimsical enchanted forest.',

The concept for the columns was influenced by the multi-functional role each firefighter plays on the team. Also it was influenced by the community and its diversity, as well as how the community relates to and perceives the firefighters (and vice versa). <br/><br/>The 8’ tall columns bases are articulated like the equipment fittings found on the rigs and hydrants. On the stainless steel columns are etched images of firefighters and historic firefighters from cultures from throughout history: 1) Wildland firefighter, 2) Explorers (youth firefighter program), 3) Vigiles Urbani (the first organized fire brigade of Europe), 4) Knight of Malta (where the current Maltese cross on firefighters emblem originated), 5) Edo Firefighter (early Japanese firefighter) and 6) Sapeurs-Pompiers (the first professional firefighters from the French Army of the 19th century). <br/><br/>Each column is divided into three parts that can be turned individually, like a section of a mix ‘n match puzzle so that the figures can be morphed into any number of combinations.<br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Guardians-of-the-Garden-City--436',

          'The main theme of the artwork is Cemanahuac: the location of the individual within his/her community as well as within the cosmos. According to Mesoamerican indigenous cultures and oral traditions, each of the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) corresponds to an element, a community memory of value, a time of day, and a color of corn  a fundamental agricultural symbol:    East is fire, family, sunrise, and red corn  West is wind, local heroes, sunset, and yellow corn  South is earth, work, noon, and blue corn  North is water, history, night, and white corn.  These symbols honor the Mexican community in various forms throughout the plaza: Four patterned metal grilles in the windows of the tower introduce traditional ironwork with pre-Columbian designs.  Metal work is continued in each of the gates into the plaza.  Mosaic thresholds inside the gates explore the theme of location and direction. The thresholds were inspired by mosaics commonly seen in Mexican colonial cities such as Taxco, Puebla and Tlaxcala and mosaic work in San Jose.    The garden alcoves are offering places linked by thematic press tiles to the cardinal directions and dedicated to a community value. The tiles were created by community members during a series of public workshops. The photographic tiles were translated from family albums and personal collections contributed by the local community.    A recurring image of the hummingbird, derived from Mesoamerican motifs, can be seen at the water fountain and on two accent walls at the south and east entrances. The hummingbird, an ancient Mesoamerican talisman, is a symbol of love and the warrior spirit. It is common in San Jose, a tiny but tenacious bird that migrates thousands of miles from Mexico to California every year and plays a role in shaping the landscape by pollinating the plants from which it drinks nectar. The hummingbird motif is intended to speak to the spirit of immigrant citizens, their endurance, strength, tenacity, and their contributions to the culture and nature of California. The choices of planting materials in the garden were selected to attract hummingbirds.',

          "Creating a social space bringing together Convention Center event goers and the general public, the project’s central element is a 40’ diameter canopy, supported by three groups of columns. The canopy is created with six interlocking steel rings intricately held in tension by steel cables, covered by translucent polycarbonates 'leaves.'Critical to Yang’s concept for the artwork is the gathering of spoken ideas. Adjacent to the Tree is the project’s sculptural sound “booth” (the “Seed”) where a sensor activated, audible prompt, encourages community to leave a short voice message.  Once a day before morning, messages are wirelessly transmitted to sound equipment housed at the center of the canopy (the “Fruit”), where audio messages are reassembled to create the haiku-like whispers within the Tree. Some whispers remain over time; others fall away into an ever-evolving ambient music-like soundscape that the artist describes as a “self-sustaining ecology of ideas",

          'Addressing the mid-century agricultural labor history in East San José, the artist worked with the project architects to design the shape of the rotunda, the columns, the terrazzo flooring and window openings at the Hillview Library. Each of the eight free-standing structural columns is composed of a stack of tractor tires; curved staves milled from recycled old-growth redwood, which are evocative of a harvest basket; the stainless steel can that pays homage to the canneries; and madrone branches, an indigenous tree revered by the local Ohlone Native Americans. <br/><br/>Trachtenberg was also captivated by the intrinsic beauty of the farmed landscape, inspiration which she captured and reflected in the other component of Groundwork: a series of twenty-six paintings called The Shadow Frieze. The paintings that encircle the rotunda below the window openings evoke the aerial views of tilled earth, orchards, and crop rows. <br/><br/> These were created in 2007. <br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Groundwork-and-The-Shadow-Fri-478',

The artwork explores the relationship between art and technology, and celebrates the earth’s basic natural resources as the foundation of technological innovation. \r\n\r\nOrigin is comprised of several integral elements. A gilded, nine-foot diameter tower rises 45’ from the lower level’s terrazzo floor. The terrazzo floor design, which can easily be seen from the upper levels and the staircase as one descends, is derived from the pattern of an early integrated circuit. Natural granite boulders placed within the floor space provide informal seating. Upon further exploration the viewer looks up to a suspended tree-root system covered in gold leaf. An elegant spectrum of ever unfolding colored lights play across the interior surfaces of the tower and interact\r\nwith the suspended gilded root system. This play of light patterns is\r\nthe result of a solar light sculpture at the roof level which gathers\r\nsunlight and projects it through a series of mirrors to an imaging\r\nmechanism inside the tower.',

          'The artwork consists of three separate artwork:The Tree of Knowledge includes three glass panes in the window wall that runs the length of the Library\'s main lobby. The artwork builds on the idea of age rings in the cross-section of a tree trunk: images in each concentric ring speak to a specific period of history and growth in the region, from the earliest period of indigenous inhabitants to the present. Bibliotree is sculptural element in the form of a tall flourishing tree made of water jet cut steel. The cut outs in the trunk are letters from the alphabets of the many languages contained in the Library\'s collection. On the lower branches of the tree are books and objects associated with reading; these continue onto the higher branches, which also contain objects representing newer forms of media. In this way the work suggests a developmental progression: the roots of language in letters and alphabets flourish into literature and on into other media. Orchard Walk, 26 thematic sidewalk insets made of stainless steel and flamed granite, are embedded in the concrete along the walkway that runs between Santa Teresa Blvd. and the Library entrance. The insets each feature the title of a literary, media or music reference, each with a different fruit in the title along with the author’s, director’s or composer’s name and a corresponding fruit image. The titles were drawn from world literature and media as well as items in the Library collection. Orchard Walk also includes a "welcome mat" in the main entrance to the Library. It contains whimsical images of two people, male and female, tending a garden and framed in the words "Cultivate Your Mind in the Orchard of Knowledge," the artist’s unifying theme for the group of artworks.',

Water flows from the Tule Reed Drain into a runnel on top of the Strata Wall, and then cascades onto a splash stone and into the landscape. Like water, light sustains the community from plant growth to the flow of electric energy essential to high tech.

The artists created three different artworks, positioned in locations throughout the shopping center parking lot and also on the front and side wall of the Target store. The three distinct works make reference to historic Mexican art forms while integrating the artists' distinct and often humorous take on contemporary culture.  The de la Torre brothers incorporate time-honored styles such as Mexican folk art and  symbols of Catholicism as well as universal subjects such gender roles and cultural integration. As a result, viewers of their work are able to place one foot in the worlds of pre-Columbian Mexico while the other is planted firmly in contemporary society",

The artwork consists of two elements: a vertical 30’ sculptural representation of a glider wing formed of tubular steel and covered in steel mesh, and the colored concrete plaza textured with linear patterns that flow around the wing element in an airflow pattern similar to that around an ascending plane wing. Soaring Flight is positioned with Montgomery Hill as a backdrop, the site of many of his pioneering flights. <br/>Phrases and quotes associated with Montgomery’s work are sandblasted into the plaza; benches are placed around the perimeter of the plaza. Together these elements create, in Roberts’ words, <br/> “A haven where visitors may learn about local history and Montgomery specifically, as well as reflect upon human invention...a subject so significantly linked to San Jose.” <br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Discoveries-Evergreen-Branch--476',

        description:
          'Anna Valentina Murch’s Garden Park is situated in Edenvale Park next to the historic Hayes Mansion. Through public meetings, Murch discovered that the community wanted an artwork that was inspired by the vast history of the site. They asked for the piece to incorporate elements of the indigenous people of the valley, the agricultural era, Frontier Village - the 1960s era amusement park located on the site, the Hayes family orchards, and the garden of Mary Hayes. They also desired an artwork that revolved around a theme of transition, both physically and symbolically, to represent the transformation of the park through the master plan and the restoration of wildlife. Lastly, they hoped that Murch’s artwork would be a place of contemplation and peace. Murch’s artwork features a stone circle in the middle of the garden covered in round holes, reminiscent of Native American pounding holes, which function as waterholes for wildlife. To the north of the stone circle is an oak grove, which also references indigenous people who were dependent upon acorns as a staple of their diet. Ornamental cherry trees are planted to the west and east of the circle in remembrance of the Hayes’s orchard and the valley’s agricultural past. A bridge leads away from the circle towards the mansion over a moat of wildflowers in honor of Frontier Village. Lavender is found on the far edge of the oak grove, creating a rich scent nostalgic of Mary Hayes’ healing garden. This peaceful artwork provides an area for quiet meditation on the transition of the seasons and the transformation of the park’s historic value. Students from neighboring elementary, middle and high schools participated in the creation of the artwork and, in the past, used it as a touchstone for a curriculum about the community.',

Located in the viewing garden that spans the northeast facade of the Evergreen Branch Library, Larry Kirkland’s sculpture speaks of the human potential for learning and exploration through our senses. According to the artist: <br/> “What unites all people is our search to understand our world and existence. From the moment we are born we begin the process of discovery that continues throughout our lives.  For that reason I have decided to title the sculptures Discoveries.” <br/><br/> The concept of the pieces was to suggest the universal human potential for exploration and learning through our senses.The three large white marble stones were found in Carrara, Italy in the same place where Michelangelo sourced stone for his carvings over 500 years ago. The carving of the stones into an ear, mouth, and eye, show the human forms emerging out of the rough hewn boulders. It is a balance of the beauty of the natural stone and the beautiful carving of the human forms. <br/><br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Soaring-Flight-Evergreen-Park-441',

The installation is comprised of several parts including three water features, a covered seating area, and a unique golf ball washer.  Water from the creek flows into a series of water features starting with a circular pool in which water continuously drips from a bamboo pipe disturbing the tranquil surface of the water. A second pool is at the center of this feature formed by a weir (a small overflow dam used to alter the flow of a river or stream). Water flows over the edge of the weir to a natural pond below decorated  with mud-like imprints of animal tracks, plant impressions, and human marks.  A bench made of concrete, sandstone, and granite sits next to the water features and is decorated with the image of ripples in a pool. The steel canopy’s leaf and animal silhouettes cast a dappled light effect on the bench.  The ball washer is activated like a drinking fountain. The spiral motion of the golf ball as it is washed acts as a meditative and focusing activity for golfers.',

The frieze is decorated with cutouts of cats and dogs emphasizing their curious and jovial natures. At night the frieze it lit from behind, highlighting the cutouts. Two sentinel statues of a dog and a cat stand on either side of the entrance; heraldic figures guarding the center. These free standing engravings of granite and steel are placed upon models of the animal care center accentuating the purpose of the center as an animal care facility.  The “Gallery of Myths” is a series of eight granite tablets along the portico of the building, which describe stories, myths, or aphorisms about cats and dogs connecting humanity with the mythos of pets.',

Platforms are defined by location, data and power provisions, equipment space, and physical attachments. Artists are given the unique opportunity to work with these platforms in designing their artworks. \r\n\r\nSupporting research report and schematic strategy documents for the Art + Technology Program’s Art Activation are available under Plans & Documents.\r\n\r\nArt Activation Infrastructure\r\nArtists: Banny Banerjee · Matt Gorbet · Susan LK Gorbet \r\n\r\nThe Art + Technology Program is built on a foundation of flexible ‘platforms’ for artists to use in creating technology and data-driven art.  The multi-disciplinary team of Gorbet+Banerjee designed art program infrastructure, determining appropriate locations, data, power and structure for artists to employ now and in the future. The infrastructure accommodates projection based, digital and data-driven artworks, and can be changed over time in keeping with the inevitable technological changes of the future.',

          'Show Your Stripes follows the artist’s interest in the use of patterns. The phrase “show your stripes” has long been used to indicate social or political position; show what you’re made of, which side are you on. At one point in history, stripes were relegated to the margins of society: jugglers, courtesans, and in Medieval paintings the devil is often shown wearing stripes. Over time, stripes have taken on a more positive connotation: freedom, playfulness, or with banker’s pinstripes – taste and status. The artwork is not simply a light show. For the changes to be activated, it takes viewer participation, as the activation phone number above indicates. A quiet reflector of the changing sky during the day, at night the piece transforms into San Jose’s shared secret – the phone number a pass code to control the changing patterns. In 2015, launching the first of a series of light-based artworks that will appear throughout downtown San José as part of the “Illuminating Downtown Project,” the artist was invited to develop a new series of interactive programs based on community input. After completing a simple and fun survey, the Mr. Conti choreographed a sequence of unique stripes based on participants’ answers.  Some number sequences relate to a community member’s favorite song or color, others are simply employed for their dynamism or beauty. A menu of over 300 codes is available in the document section above.   Artwork Activation:  Call 408.287.0128After The Tone, Enter any 3 digit combination from 1 - 9 Press “0” (Zero), Then Hang UpNote: Not all combinations are programmed – yet',

          'FOGWASTE is a public art installation and community outreach effort. The project targets communities with a three-phase approach that together reinforce the important work of DOT’s sewer maintenance staff, the importance of the community in understanding of FOG (Fat Oil and Grease), the sanitary sewer infrastructure, and the potential actions that residents can take to achieve a positive impact on the sewer system, the environment, and their communities. The project elements work together to stimulate community curiosity, encourage participation in best household practices, and promote environmental stewardship:Doorhanger:  Addressing the issue directly at the household, a bold graphic poster is distributed as a door hanger by DOT crews in the vicinity of recent sanitary sewer maintenance activity. The poster features simple and engaging icons to educate about various FOG wastes and common household products not to be put in sinks; the poster also brings awareness to features of the infrastructure system. Printed in the project’s signature electric green color, the door hanger connects to the other art elements described below. Multi-lingual text provides explanation and vocabulary for a more informed community. Manhole Marker: Bringing attention to the infrastructure below the streets, manholes of recently serviced sewer lines were painted in the project’s signature electric green color, creating awareness of this largely unnoticed infrastructure. Painting of the manholes coincided with the distribution of door hangers creating a connection from the front door to the system under the street. Maintenance Truck Graphic: A bold vinyl graphic was applied to select sewer maintenance trucks traveling to the target neighborhoods that features a design that calls out the 24/7 sewer maintenance service provided by the City. The vinyl graphic will be rendered in the project’s signature electric green color reinforcing the connection between the truck, door hangers and manhole markers and the workforce that is constantly on the move to manage the system. DistrictCity Wide Report a concern (408) 793-4330 or publicart@sanjoseca.gov',

This project honors a pioneer settlement and its founders and the beginnings of a continuous migration of people who have come to this region from north, south, east, and west. The migration is represented through four columns placed at each point of the compass. Each triangle shaped column has cast relief images on the outside walls and a tile mural on the inner face. Polished granite slabs top each of the columns with a descriptive title for the art on the face of the column. A tile floor map depicts the trek of the original settlers from the Sonora desert to what is today the city of San José.',

These provide children with perfect places to curl up and read a book.  The third element, The Tree, recalls a magical tree in a fairy tale.

          "Valerie Raps created this in partnership with Don Imwalle, Imwalle Stegner Development and San José Redevelopment Agency in 2011. The artwork is part of the Alum Rock Cultural History Corridor (ARCHC), which seeks to celebrate the rich cultural history of east San José through artworks and other elements. <br/><br/>Raps’ sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved ‘tines’ that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. <br/><br/>The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow’s curved 'tines', miming the harrow’s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community. The arms in the artwork are castings of real community members, underscoring the artwork’s connection to the area and to this community (see fact sheet for detail). Each person has a real connection to the idea represented in the work. <br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Cultivating-Community-Tropica-458",

          'This work includes four art glass windows located in the children\'s area and a suspended glass lamp near the library entrance.The artwork\'s visual imagery refers to ancient alphabets as the foundation of the written word, which in turn is fundamental to libraries and illumination of the mind. Each pane contains characters in different scripts that are the basis for written Latin, Russian, Vietnamese and some Indian languages. These are lineages of the languages that presently are predominant in the Pearl Avenue Branch Library collection. The lamp is inscribed with ancient Sumerian cuneiform script which repeats the text "We are all one."  The lamp is lit with color changing LEDs, programmed to cycle on 30-minute intervals through the color spectrum. In this way the lamp also functions as a timepiece. Another critical but unseen aspect to the artwork are photovoltaic cells that are embedded in the four glass panes. These collect solar energy that then provides power to light the lamp. Through this work the artist is seeking to awaken people to the miracle of language and writing as the key to understanding the past, expressing the present and imagining the future. The artist also wants to raise awareness of the real possibilities of harnessing available energy to provide for basic needs.',

          "This statue of Captain Thomas Fallon was commissioned in 1988.  It memorializes the raising of the U.S. flag in San Jose in 1846, when California was still a part of Mexico.  Scheduled to be installed in 1990, the statue generated an intense controversy.  Supporters of the artwork believed that it commemorated an important historical event in San Jose's history.  Opponents of the statue responded that it represented a troubling moment in American history, when the United States used the Mexican -American War as a reason to annex California from Mexico. To address the issues arising from the controversy, the City appointed a Historic Art Advisory Committee.     The committee recommended that the City's public art must represent all perspectives of the City's history.  Four additional projects were recommended - artworks commemorating the Ohlone Way of Life, the life of Dr. Ernesto Galarza, the Founding of the Pueblo, and the Agricultural History of the Valley.  These works have been installed in various locations around the city.  This artwork is a reminder that a community's historic events can be interpreted in many ways, depending upon one's perspective.",

The design for the installation was developed through discussion among Art in Community class members who were inspired by a visit to the koi pond in the Japanese Friendship Garden in San Jose’s Kelley Park. The design uses the park sidewalk as a “meandering stream” populated by a variety of fish. The fish represent the diversity of individuals from many cultures that live in the Martha Gardens neighborhood. The fish are also a playful reference to elaborate water features and ornamental fishponds.',

          'The movie marquee became a familiar downtown architectural feature with the popularization of cinema in the 1920\'s and 1930\'s. Its objective of transmitting information to the street was fully realized at night with illuminated displays as a form of urban seduction.  A contemporary interpretation of the marquee suggests not only technical revision for this transmission of information, but a rethinking of urban communication. Jump Cuts reinterprets the mechanism of the marquee through sculptural, electronic and video elements, broadcasting images and texts, both informational and contemplative, to the street. The artwork transforms the visual accessibility of the lobby by alternating between the actual view from the street and live video views from within, thus flipping the building inside-out and back, electronically.  The project includes twelve 5\' by 6\'- 8" liquid-crystal display panels mounted on the outside of the glass facade of the building. By day, viewers see text permanently etched onto the surface of the glass panels.  From the outside, the text reads, "Truth is stranger than fiction is stranger than truth..."  From inside the lobby, the text reads, "Life imitates art imitates life..." In the evening, the LCD panels  are transformed into video screens.  Images projected onto the screens sequence between movie trailers and live feed from video cameras mounted inside the lobby.  In between these sequences, the screens become transparent, allowing full view of the interior lobby.  A computer controls all of the dynamic elements of the marquee, including activating the panels, turning them translucent and providing the surface upon which images can be projected.  The image sequencing is preprogrammed for the twelve months of the year to begin operation at dusk and continue through midnight.',

          "The design of this commemorative artwork connects San Jose State University with Plaza de Cesar Chavez, in the heart of the City's downtown.  The artwork references Dr. Ernesto Galarza’s life-long pursuit of bridging academic and civil life and referencing the many facets of his work, including academia, poetry, education and labor organizing.  The work is composed of three elements:\r\n\r\nLibrary Table:\r\nThe surface of the cast-concrete library table is inlaid with bronze farm tools, a cast-bronze field-worker's hat, photo-etched black granite portraits, photo-etched ceramic tiles and bronze text.  The relief surface of the table is designed to encourage pedestrians to view and touch the inlaid elements.\r\n\r\nCast Bronze Chair\r\nAt the west end of the table, facing Plaza de Cesar Chavez, an empty cast-bronze chair with a wooden seat serves as a metaphor for Dr. Galarza as the field worker who took his scholarly practice into the world.  The chair is a functional element, and is intended to encourage visitors to stop, sit and explore the information contained in the table surface.\r\n\r\nRibbons of Terrazzo\r\nThe ribbons of terrazzo are 11\" wide and of varying length, and lace through the existing Paseo paving in each of the four blocks.  Designed to have a subtle physical and visual impact upon the Paseo, these ribbons are intended to draw the pedestrian through the length of the walkway.  The terrazzo is inlaid with bronze text, in both English and Spanish, introducing the commemoration through personal recollections about Dr. Galarza's life and work from his family, friends and colleagues.",

The embossed leaves also have a fossil-like design nostalgic of the fruit orchards that used to inhabit the site. <br/><br/>Community participation was an integral part of the design of this project. <br/><br/> The project was created in 1999.

He is the City's first Photographer-in-Residence at their Wastewater Treatment Facility. Like ancient Rome our contemporary culture was made possible by a vast system of water delivery and sewage treatment to maintain a large and healthy population. Most of us are generally unaware of this system until it doesn't work. Dawson's photographs of this infrastructure depict a huge, complex but delicate machine. The entire system is estimated to be valued at $2 billion. Approximately $1 billion will be needed to repair or replace parts over the next ten years. Dawson's work is intended to bring attention to this invisible part of our local government and to help generate awareness of when government works.",

The artwork references text, language, and writing – the tools which poets and playwrights have used throughout history. It is a metaphor for the technology of the written word and for the flight of imagination.  \r\n\r\nThe artwork is composed of two main elements: a 24-foot illuminated quill and a circular element which supports a perforated steel screen with cut-out text. Both the quill and the circle are supported by a 16-foot tapered mast. The quill is mounted on bearings allowing it to rotate in the wind. The structure of both elements is composed of stainless steel tubing. \r\n\r\nThe artwork also features text from William Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and reads “We are such stuff as dreams are made on...” This piece celebrates language as a triumph of human ingenuity. As Douglas Hollis said, “Birds fly in air, fish swim in water and humans live in language.”',

          "Five Skaters commemorates the San Jose region’s unique concentration of professional figure skating champions: Brian Boitano, Peggy Fleming-Jenkins, Rudy Galindo, Debi Thomas and Kristi Yamaguchi. Five Skaters honors the art and sport of figure skating, San Jose’s local champions and others who have contributed to its vitality, tradition and popularity. The artwork consists of three parts: five monumental columns, a large terrazzo ice rink, and three winners' podiums. The 20 foot-tall columns are clad with mosaics of black, white and gray ceramic tiles featuring photographic images of the five San Jose Area champions and convey the spirit of championship, including the pressures of competition, the scrutiny of the judges, the presence of the live audience, and the watchful eye of the press.The oval-shaped terrazzo rink is surrounded by built-in seating. Thin metal strips are embedded in the terrazzo curve throughout the rink creating patterns like those etched in ice by skate blades. Complementing these curves, text conveying the personal recollections of each champion swirl about the ice. The surface of the rink also features five recessed niches; these contain display photographs and personal memorabilia of the San Jose area figure skating champions. The final element of the work is a set of three winners' circles, cylindrical disks of varying heights; these reference the award podiums for medalists. They are designed so that anyone can stand on them and experience a personal moment of championship.",

The steps rise in increments to form terracing that appears completely natural to its setting. The installation creates a fluid motion in stone, commencing at the top of one hill, flowing down to the base and then back up the second hill. The title of this artwork suggests the view from above: as seen from a bird’s eye view, the work references the shadow of a bird in flight as cast on the earth below.

The artist inspired by this and further intrigued by the transformation of butterflies, and that as a metaphor for the human life process from childhood to maturity. With these ideas in mind Ms. Liew created Trees of Knowledge: two "trees" formed by integrating painted elements, positioned to suggest treetops, onto columns of the building. Their shape also echoes that of butterfly wings and each is painted with rich, colorful mythological imagery. Ms. Liew suggests that these, "serve as a gateway to the world of imagination and learning that await the visitors to the Children\'s section of the library."   Ms. Liew\'s Metamorphosis - Transformation in the Woods is a painting in the form of butterfly wings. Located in the Storytelling Corner, these are positioned so as to frame the storyteller. Colorful imagery on the wings references characters from classic fairytales, nursery rhymes set in the forest, and folklore and is intended to inspire positive themes for young readers.',

Draping across the roof line of The Pierce, a residential apartment building in Downtown San Jose, Voxel Cloud serves as a gateway marker for San José’s SoFA Art District, The dynamic, illuminated, data-driven LED sculpture takes its visual cues from natural forms as varied as water particles, interstellar star systems, the crystalline aggregates of silicon carbide, and the multi-chromatic raw materials of semiconductor wafers. <br/><br/> Voxel Cloud was made possible through a partnership between the project owner/developer, Sares Regis Group of Northern California, Pritzker Realty Group, and the City of San José Public Art Program. It was supported in part by an ArtPlace grant (www.artplaceamerica.org). It is the fifth of six Illuminating Downtown Project (IDP) grants awarded for creative placemaking projects in San José, bringing artists and arts organizations together to enrich the city and its communities. IDP combines art and technology to physically manifest San José’s aspiration for creating a more engaging downtown—whether someone is approaching from the surrounding freeways or walking its streets.

          'Waterscape\r\nArtists: Anna Valentina Murch and Doug Hollis\r\n\r\nThis water sculpture was inspired by the natural geological and artesian conditions underlying the San Jose region. \r\n\r\nThe specific design of Waterscape is composed of two topographic fields of monumental granite slabs. The fields slope from Santa Clara Street toward the City Hall plaza allowing the water to flow down the surface of the fields onto the plaza in subtle ripples. Water also flows over the vertical stone on the fountain edges, disappearing beneath the plaza, creating walls of water that define the perimeter along Santa Clara Street. The water within the field is programmed to respond to changes in time of day, temperature, season and availability of water to create different visual, sonic and atmospheric qualities. The piece is illuminated at night for a distinctive evening identity.',

While the artist translated some of the drawings for a cohesive style, the artwork is still distinctively based on the youths’ artwork. <br/><br/>The shape of the chandelier, hanging in the oculus of the lobby, celebrate the themes of life with sculptural elements that look like DNA strands or plant forms.

It is a way to engage art,\r\nlight and technology in a larger vision of the downtown, while considering ways of making the downtown\r\na more livable, enjoyable, engaging place.\r\nSensing YOU is an interactive artwork defined by over 1000 painted circles and 81 individually controlled illuminated rings that play a variety of patterns and low-resolution mapped video over the ceiling surface of the I-87 highway underpass at Santa Clara Street. The patterns are activated by pedestrians and bicyclists moving through the space- setting off pre-programmed sequences.Sensing WATER, a weather-responding and interactive artwork utilizing light and paint to define the downtown gateway at Highway 87 and San Fernando St. The project is composed of 2 elements, the massive painted sloped wall that abstractly references flowing water, and the overhead evening lighting that illuminates with rippling patterns of light the underpass. The project uses real-time NOAA weather data to compose different patterns of light on the ceiling.

Once prolific, they are now most often decaying and abandoned, glimpsed only briefly from a distance by motorists on the freeway. The structures, a water tank tower, a windmill, a barn and a small shed, are intended to be somewhat ghost-like in their transparent appearance.

          'Internationally-recognized photographer Catherine Wagner created a dynamic architectural frieze that investigates ideas about knowledge, nature, wonder and discovery. This frieze is installed on the clerestory walls of the library entrance, and consists of printed images laminated to aluminum panels. Source material for the photos includes trees, rocks and plants from Overfelt Gardens, as well as Chinese Scholars’ Rocks from some of the preeminent collections in the United States.Integrated into the installation at the west end of the building is the signage for the Library’s “Tech Connect” area. This sign is comprised of two parts—the practical wayfinding text, and the surrounding cellular image forms. The cellular pattern was made using Voronoi diagrams for points that are algorithmically distributed through the panel and concentrated within the letter forms. So, abstractly the cells are defined by the letters and the surrounding images themselves. The “Tech Connect” sign was designed by Michael Thompson of Coded Meaning, a frequent collaborator with Ms. Wagner.',

          'One July Saturday in 2005, a San Jose resident took a walk with his dog along the Guadalupe River, just north of the San Jose International Airport. He recognized that the objects poking out of the ground that day were clearly unusual -- he had discovered the tusks and skeleton of a mammoth.<br/><br/> <em>Lupe the Mammoth</em> was inspired by this discovery. <br/>The artwork is a technology-driven design with hand-crafted sensibilities. While the actual mammoth was a juvenile and about 8’ tall, the sculpture measures 12.5’ in height and is made of galvanized steel. The artwork was painstakingly fabricated at Paramount Roll & Forming; bent piece by piece and fit into a notched support structure after which it was galvanized for its final finish. <br/><br/> The artwork is titled “Lupe,” but has quickly assumed the nickname Lupe the Mammoth as a popular post on social media; #LupeTheMammoth. <br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Lupe-the-Mammoth-Guadalupe-Tr-559',

          'The design of Echo grew out of discussions between the artist and architect and their desire to define the nighttime identity of the building and enliven the nighttime identity of the downtown. On San Fernando Street, the vertical spaces of the elevator towers read as monolithic volumes of light in three colors. As one color slowly dims another color is brought up in intensity to fill the volume of space. The elevators themselves have standard incandescent lights and are visible traveling through the volume of color.Centered within the nine foot by six foot bays of the building, behind the perforated metal façade, are 24 three-foot squares of neon light controlled by individual random fading transformers. The rectangular mass created by the 24 boxes illuminates the building façade. The squares of light float, change color, and fade constantly, but subtly, create new patterns and compositions.',
