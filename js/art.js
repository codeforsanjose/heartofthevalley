Located in the viewing garden that spans the northeast facade of the Evergreen Branch Library, Larry Kirkland’s sculpture speaks of the human potential for learning and exploration through our senses. According to the artist: <br/> “What unites all people is our search to understand our world and existence. From the moment we are born we begin the process of discovery that continues throughout our lives.  For that reason I have decided to title the sculptures Discoveries.” <br/><br/> The concept of the pieces was to suggest the universal human potential for exploration and learning through our senses.The three large white marble stones were found in Carrara, Italy in the same place where Michelangelo sourced stone for his carvings over 500 years ago. The carving of the stones into an ear, mouth, and eye, show the human forms emerging out of the rough hewn boulders. It is a balance of the beauty of the natural stone and the beautiful carving of the human forms. <br/><br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Soaring-Flight-Evergreen-Park-441",

The artwork consists of two elements: a vertical 30’ sculptural representation of a glider wing formed of tubular steel and covered in steel mesh, and the colored concrete plaza textured with linear patterns that flow around the wing element in an airflow pattern similar to that around an ascending plane wing. Soaring Flight is positioned with Montgomery Hill as a backdrop, the site of many of his pioneering flights. <br/>Phrases and quotes associated with Montgomery’s work are sandblasted into the plaza; benches are placed around the perimeter of the plaza. Together these elements create, in Roberts’ words, <br/> “A haven where visitors may learn about local history and Montgomery specifically, as well as reflect upon human invention...a subject so significantly linked to San Jose.” <br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Discoveries-Evergreen-Branch--476",

The artwork is part of the Alum Rock Cultural History Corridor (ARCHC), which seeks to celebrate the rich cultural history of east San José through artworks and other elements. <br/><br/>Raps’ sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved ‘tines’ that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. <br/><br/>The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow’s curved 'tines', miming the harrow’s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community. The arms in the artwork are castings of real community members, underscoring the artwork’s connection to the area and to this community (see fact sheet for detail). Each person has a real connection to the idea represented in the work. <br/><br/> Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-Cultivating-Community-Tropica-458",

It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine. <br/><br/> In 2006, Gloria Bornstein was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San José's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. <br/><br/>Source: City of San José Public Art Program, http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Facilities/Facility/Details/Public-Art-A-Monument-to-the-Last-Barn-E-442",
