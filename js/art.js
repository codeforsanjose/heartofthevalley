        "description": "Trees\r\nArtist: Angela Buenning Filo\r\n2006\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1737 Trees is a grid of photographic portraits of every tree in one of San Jose’s last orchards. \r\n\r\nAngela Buenning Filo was inspired to photograph these trees by a November 10th, 2002 newspaper article that described a San Jose prune orchard as the last in Silicon Valley. She drove in search of it and found the strip of trees alongside the IBM campus on Cottle Road and photographed the trees. When, in the following months Filo's thoughts kept returning to the trees, she decided to document the orchard before it was destroyed. It was then she set out to make an individual portrait of each of the orchard’s 1,737 trees with the intention of arranging the finished photographs in the same grid in which the trees were planted in the orchard. \r\n\r\nBy this time IBM, which had preserved the orchard on its property for decades, had sold the land, and a large billboard announced that the 42 acres were up for sale again. Filo worked over the next three years, choosing to photograph the trees’ leafless branches in winter under overcast skies. With the orchard still standing, but the land slated for development, she photographed the final tree in 2006.",

        "description": "The National Fire Protection Association recommends a target of 8 minutes as “standard response time” for emergency calls. The artwork 8 Minutes approaches the topic of the 8-minute response in three ways:\r\n\r\n1. A visual measurement of 8 minutes,\r\n2. A conveyor of Fire Station 24th continuous efforts on behalf of the community, and\r\n3. Connecting the community to the station via the eight minute duration.\r\n\r\nAll the elements complement each other to create a rich understanding of time in the context of Fire Station 24.\r\n\r\nThe first element is the LED Countdown Timer placed over the apparatus bay. The timer is connected to the fire pager system; when a response call is received it automatically starts an 8-minute counter that travels as a light across the sign. After the 8-minute light completes its travel across the sign, the \"call time\" is added to a list of the 8 most recent call times displayed on the sign. The second and third components of the artwork are a series of tiles in the fire station entryway. One set of tiles is a compilation of text about the number 8 and 8-minute duration. For example: “A fallen or lying down 8 is used to represent infinity in mathematics.” The third component is a series of 8-minute time-lapsed community photographs that depict every day activities to the same time frame of the recommended standard response time – to provide visitors to the station a visceral sense of the anxiety-filled 8 minutes awaiting emergency response versus the same 8-minutes washing a car, skateboarding or barbecuing.",

        "description": "A native of San Jose, Emma Prusch bequeathed her 47 acre dairy farm to the City in 1962. The deed to the City specified that the City “will make said park a place of relaxation, recreation, and enjoyment for the people of the City of San Jose, and in such a manner as will, to extent that such can be   reasonably done, give to said park a rural county character and atmosphere.” Emma Prusch Farm Park includes heritage, high density, and rare fruit orchards, a Plant Science Center, two community gardens, pollinator and butterfly gardens, as well as acres of lush green lawns for picnics and playing. It also has one of the largest free standing wooden barns in California, home to 4H large animals including beef cattle, sheep, and swine. \r\n\r\nThe artist was inspired by the story of Emma Prusch, San Jose's rich agricultural history and the continuing traditions. A Monument to the Last Barn draws upon this influence: the form is a four-sided metal structure derived from traditional Santa Clara barns, but stripped of outer cladding to reveal the essential framework. This iconic linkage to early barns is further underscored by the rich, deep barn red color of the piece. The barn’s corrugated galvanized steel roof is topped with three golden wind vanes depicting a rooster, a windmill and an apple. The gables and railings are inset with filigree screens in a bold “fruits and leaves” pattern, representing the orchards that were so vital to the region. Benches placed inside the barn create an inviting and reflective atmosphere amidst the lively park grounds. The artist conceived of this work as homage to the last great large barn on the site at Prusch Farm Park.",

        "description": "The Public Art Program collaborated with Happy Hollow to select internationally recognized artist Tom Otterness to create an artwork for the new entry plaza. The artwork consists of 17 bronze pieces each reflecting an element of the Park or the Zoo. As the artist has said: For me the sculptures at HHPZ serve to launch an experience, not to mimic anything inside HHPZ; it’s a fairy tale—animals drive cars and money is food.Some characteristic motifs seen in other Otterness works are found in Another World—including manipulation of human and animal scale, depictions of coins and bills, use of clothing—to add humorous and thought-provoking aspects to the artwork. These unifying motifs allow the viewer to explore a central theme of this artwork: what is the relationship between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom?",

The repeated use of weaving (in representational forms, and in more abstract renderings of roadways and paths) is intended to suggest the complexity and organization of human knowledge. Likewise, the illustration of locally-cultivated fruits in grid patterns refers not only to the agricultural history of orchards near the site, but also to the gathering and categorization of information as it occurs in a library. Pastoral imagery dominates the work, remembering and celebrating ways of life which have largely vanished from the area.",

        "description": "The artwork is a commemoration of the black walnut trees that once covered the area. The artwork, five cast concrete vessel seats with bronze leaf and seed elements cast into the top of each, creates a contemplative space within the park.  Inset bronze leaves, spirals and black walnut centers are placed at junctions along the pathways in the park.Cynthia Handel participated in the City of San José Public Art Program’s Artist’s Training Project in 1997. Following the workshop series, participants were invited to submit proposals for upcoming City-funded public art projects. Cynthia’s proposal for the upgrading of Meadowfair Park was one of the accepted proposals.",

        "description": "The San José Public Art Program in association with project developer Blake Hunt Ventures, commissioned Einar and Jamex de la Torre to collaborate with the community in the creation of artwork for the Story & King Development. The artists created three different artworks, positioned in locations throughout the shopping center parking lot and also on the front and side wall of the Target store. The three distinct works make reference to historic Mexican art forms while integrating the artists' distinct and often humorous take on contemporary culture.  The de la Torre brothers incorporate time-honored styles such as Mexican folk art and  symbols of Catholicism as well as universal subjects such gender roles and cultural integration. As a result, viewers of their work are able to place one foot in the worlds of pre-Columbian Mexico while the other is planted firmly in contemporary society",

This project honors a pioneer settlement and its founders and the beginnings of a continuous migration of people who have come to this region from north, south, east, and west. The migration is represented through four columns placed at each point of the compass. Each triangle shaped column has cast relief images on the outside walls and a tile mural on the inner face. Polished granite slabs top each of the columns with a descriptive title for the art on the face of the column. A tile floor map depicts the trek of the original settlers from the Sonora desert to what is today the city of San José.",

When constructing these massive ceramic pieces, Kaneko starts building from the bottom up. He layers slabs of clay to shape the walls allowing the bottom to dry as he builds up to the top. Then he must fire the whole structure in a kiln without cracking or breaking it. Kaneko hopes that his sculptures will spark a dialogue around what he refers to as “spiritual space.” He uses the analogy of comparing a 70 story skyscraper to a 3000 meter high mountain to explain how understanding of scale changes based on environment. The public will observe this relationship between scale and environment when standing next to these grand seven foot tall sculptures.",

Corriente de Agua (Water Current) is intended as a transitional piece between landscapes and recalls the history of the Coyote Creek. The installation is comprised of several parts including three water features, a covered seating area, and a unique golf ball washer.  Water from the creek flows into a series of water features starting with a circular pool in which water continuously drips from a bamboo pipe disturbing the tranquil surface of the water. A second pool is at the center of this feature formed by a weir (a small overflow dam used to alter the flow of a river or stream). Water flows over the edge of the weir to a natural pond below decorated  with mud-like imprints of animal tracks, plant impressions, and human marks.  A bench made of concrete, sandstone, and granite sits next to the water features and is decorated with the image of ripples in a pool. The steel canopy’s leaf and animal silhouettes cast a dappled light effect on the bench.  The ball washer is activated like a drinking fountain. The spiral motion of the golf ball as it is washed acts as a meditative and focusing activity for golfers.",

The artwork builds on the idea of age rings in the cross-section of a tree trunk: images in each concentric ring speak to a specific period of history and growth in the region, from the earliest period of indigenous inhabitants to the present. Bibliotree is sculptural element in the form of a tall flourishing tree made of water jet cut steel. The cut outs in the trunk are letters from the alphabets of the many languages contained in the Library's collection. On the lower branches of the tree are books and objects associated with reading; these continue onto the higher branches, which also contain objects representing newer forms of media. In this way the work suggests a developmental progression: the roots of language in letters and alphabets flourish into literature and on into other media. Orchard Walk, 26 thematic sidewalk insets made of stainless steel and flamed granite, are embedded in the concrete along the walkway that runs between Santa Teresa Blvd. and the Library entrance. The insets each feature the title of a literary, media or music reference, each with a different fruit in the title along with the author’s, director’s or composer’s name and a corresponding fruit image. The titles were drawn from world literature and media as well as items in the Library collection. Orchard Walk also includes a \"welcome mat\" in the main entrance to the Library. It contains whimsical images of two people, male and female, tending a garden and framed in the words \"Cultivate Your Mind in the Orchard of Knowledge,\" the artist’s unifying theme for the group of artworks.",

Raps’ sculpture is in the form of a life size 'spring-tooth harrow', an iconic piece of farm equipment used to cultivate the land by aerating the soil with curved ‘tines’ that turn the soil as the harrow is pulled along. The sculpture depicts ten human arms cast in bronze replace the harrow’s curved 'tines', miming the harrow’s purpose but with human hands turning the soil. The sculpture thus symbolically depicts the many human hands that worked the fields and speaks to the agricultural work and hard physical labor that has been such an important part of the community. It further suggests the idea of cultural diversity and the power of people working together to build community.  The arms in the artwork are castings of real community members, underscoring the artwork’s connection to the area and to this community (see fact sheet for detail). Each person has a real connection to the idea represented in the work.",

According to the artist: “What unites all people is our search to understand our world and existence.  From the moment we are born we begin the process of discovery that continues throughout our lives.  For that reason I have decided to title the sculptures Discoveries.\"The concept of the pieces was to suggest the universal human potential for exploration and learning through our senses.The three large white marble stones were found in Carrara, Italy in the same place where Michelangelo sourced stone for his carvings over 500 years ago. The carving of the stones into an ear, mouth, and eye, show the human forms emerging out of the rough hewn boulders. It is a balance of the beauty of the natural stone and the beautiful carving of the human forms.",

        "description": "The design of Echo grew out of discussions between the artist and architect and their desire to define the nighttime identity of the building and enliven the nighttime identity of the downtown. On San Fernando Street, the vertical spaces of the elevator towers read as monolithic volumes of light in three colors. As one color slowly dims another color is brought up in intensity to fill the volume of space. The elevators themselves have standard incandescent lights and are visible traveling through the volume of color.Centered within the nine foot by six foot bays of the building, behind the perforated metal façade, are 24 three-foot squares of neon light controlled by individual random fading transformers. The rectangular mass created by the 24 boxes illuminates the building façade. The squares of light float, change color, and fade constantly, but subtly, create new patterns and compositions.",

        "description": "Anna Valentina Murch’s Garden Park is situated in Edenvale Park next to the historic Hayes Mansion. Through public meetings, Murch discovered that the community wanted an artwork that was inspired by the vast history of the site. They asked for the piece to incorporate elements of the indigenous people of the valley, the agricultural era, Frontier Village - the 1960s era amusement park located on the site, the Hayes family orchards, and the garden of Mary Hayes. They also desired an artwork that revolved around a theme of transition, both physically and symbolically, to represent the transformation of the park through the master plan and the restoration of wildlife. Lastly, they hoped that Murch’s artwork would be a place of contemplation and peace. Murch’s artwork features a stone circle in the middle of the garden covered in round holes, reminiscent of Native American pounding holes, which function as waterholes for wildlife. To the north of the stone circle is an oak grove, which also references indigenous people who were dependent upon acorns as a staple of their diet. Ornamental cherry trees are planted to the west and east of the circle in remembrance of the Hayes’s orchard and the valley’s agricultural past. A bridge leads away from the circle towards the mansion over a moat of wildflowers in honor of Frontier Village. Lavender is found on the far edge of the oak grove, creating a rich scent nostalgic of Mary Hayes’ healing garden. This peaceful artwork provides an area for quiet meditation on the transition of the seasons and the transformation of the park’s historic value. Students from neighboring elementary, middle and high schools participated in the creation of the artwork and, in the past, used it as a touchstone for a curriculum about the community.",

        "description": "Almaden Valley is a two panel mural that flanks the stage in the community room. The left panel is a representation of the agrarian past of the Almaden Valley. The image depicts a man carrying a bushel basket. In the background is an oak tree symbolizing the eternal quality of the natural world. The right panel depicts a female figure with children dancing around her. She faces the children with her arms stretched upward seeming to hold a transparent sphere. The sphere symbolizes the limitless possibilities of the future.   Both panels are painted on a gilt silver background (gold over silver). A limited palette of cinnabar-colored pigment is used. The silver and cinnabar reference the local mercury mines that played an important part in the development of the Almaden area. The mural has a stylistic affinity to the murals created through the federal WPA program in the 1930’s and 40’s. The connection to this rich heritage is important to artists’ vision for the work.  Evans and Brown also created two decorative murals for the Children’s Areas in the Library and Community wings of the building. As its name conveys, Enchanted Forest suggests themes of a whimsical enchanted forest.",

Five Skaters honors the art and sport of figure skating, San Jose’s local champions and others who have contributed to its vitality, tradition and popularity. The artwork consists of three parts: five monumental columns, a large terrazzo ice rink, and three winners' podiums. The 20 foot-tall columns are clad with mosaics of black, white and gray ceramic tiles featuring photographic images of the five San Jose Area champions and convey the spirit of championship, including the pressures of competition, the scrutiny of the judges, the presence of the live audience, and the watchful eye of the press.The oval-shaped terrazzo rink is surrounded by built-in seating. Thin metal strips are embedded in the terrazzo curve throughout the rink creating patterns like those etched in ice by skate blades. Complementing these curves, text conveying the personal recollections of each champion swirl about the ice. The surface of the rink also features five recessed niches; these contain display photographs and personal memorabilia of the San Jose area figure skating champions. The final element of the work is a set of three winners' circles, cylindrical disks of varying heights; these reference the award podiums for medalists. They are designed so that anyone can stand on them and experience a personal moment of championship.",

The project elements work together to stimulate community curiosity, encourage participation in best household practices, and promote environmental stewardship:Doorhanger:  Addressing the issue directly at the household, a bold graphic poster is distributed as a door hanger by DOT crews in the vicinity of recent sanitary sewer maintenance activity.

Printed in the project’s signature electric green color, the door hanger connects to the other art elements described below.

        "description": "Edenvale Park is the former location of Frontier Village, a western-themed amusement park that thrived before closing in 1980. To demarcate the site of Frontier Village, artist Jon Rubin created bird houses in five locations in the current park that geographically correspond to buildings and amusements that once existed during Frontier Village's heyday: the Railroad Station; the Main Entrance Log Tower Structures; the Mine Ride; the Old School House; and Main Street. Attached to each pole is a plaque that depicts historical photos and text providing context for the amusement park buildings that once existed. The interpretive plaque also describes the species of birds most likely to occupy this new house.",

Each of the eight free-standing structural columns is composed of a stack of tractor tires; curved staves milled from recycled old-growth redwood, which are evocative of a harvest basket; the stainless steel can that pays homage to the canneries; and madrone branches, an indigenous tree revered by the local Ohlone Indians. Trachtenberg was also captivated by the intrinsic beauty of the farmed landscape, inspiration which she captured and reflected in the other component of Groundwork: a series of twenty-six paintings called The Shadow Frieze. The paintings that encircle the rotunda below the window openings evoke the aerial views of tilled earth, orchards, and crop rows.",

The concept for the columns was influenced by the multi-functional role each firefighter plays on the team.

The 8’ tall columns bases are articulated like the equipment fittings found on the rigs and hydrants. On the stainless steel columns are etched images of firefighters and historic firefighters from cultures from throughout history: 1) Wildland firefighter, 2) Explorers (youth firefighter program), 3) Vigiles Urbani (the first organized fire brigade of Europe), 4) Knight of Malta (where the current Maltese cross on firefighters emblem originated), 5) Edo Firefighter (early Japanese firefighter) and 6) Sapeurs-Pompiers (the first professional firefighters from the French Army of the 19th century). Each column is divided into three parts that can be turned individually, like a section of a mix ‘n match puzzle so that the figures can be morphed into any number of combinations.",

        "description": "Creating a social space bringing together Convention Center event goers and the general public, the project’s central element is a 40’ diameter canopy, supported by three groups of columns. The canopy is created with six interlocking steel rings intricately held in tension by steel cables, covered by translucent polycarbonates 'leaves.'Critical to Yang’s concept for the artwork is the gathering of spoken ideas. Adjacent to the Tree is the project’s sculptural sound “booth” (the “Seed”) where a sensor activated, audible prompt, encourages community to leave a short voice message.  Once a day before morning, messages are wirelessly transmitted to sound equipment housed at the center of the canopy (the “Fruit”), where audio messages are reassembled to create the haiku-like whispers within the Tree. Some whispers remain over time; others fall away into an ever-evolving ambient music-like soundscape that the artist describes as a “self-sustaining ecology of ideas",

        "description": "This bronze bas-relief, located outside the Federal Building, is a reminder of the injustices committed against the Japanese American people and of their strength of spirit. On one side of the memorial the panels depict life prior to the internment, showing a robust, prosperous community. The other side portrays various aspects of the history and reality of life in the internment camps. There are images of Franklin Roosevelt signing Executive Order 9066 issuing the internment policy, notices for internment being sent to people of Japanese ancestry, the daily of life of the camps, and adjustment after the war. The final panel portrays the 1988 Redress in which a formal apology and compensation was issued to every survivor. In a column at the end of the wall, many \"mon\" (traditional family crests) sent in by community members are also displayed. The memorial visualizes the inhumanity and strife of the internment camps and reminds the public that fear of the “other” can lead to broad spread racism, prejudice, and discrimination.",

        "description": "The movie marquee became a familiar downtown architectural feature with the popularization of cinema in the 1920's and 1930's. Its objective of transmitting information to the street was fully realized at night with illuminated displays as a form of urban seduction.  A contemporary interpretation of the marquee suggests not only technical revision for this transmission of information, but a rethinking of urban communication. Jump Cuts reinterprets the mechanism of the marquee through sculptural, electronic and video elements, broadcasting images and texts, both informational and contemplative, to the street. The artwork transforms the visual accessibility of the lobby by alternating between the actual view from the street and live video views from within, thus flipping the building inside-out and back, electronically.  The project includes twelve 5' by 6'- 8\" liquid-crystal display panels mounted on the outside of the glass facade of the building. By day, viewers see text permanently etched onto the surface of the glass panels.  From the outside, the text reads, \"Truth is stranger than fiction is stranger than truth...\"  From inside the lobby, the text reads, \"Life imitates art imitates life...\" In the evening, the LCD panels  are transformed into video screens.  Images projected onto the screens sequence between movie trailers and live feed from video cameras mounted inside the lobby.  In between these sequences, the screens become transparent, allowing full view of the interior lobby.  A computer controls all of the dynamic elements of the marquee, including activating the panels, turning them translucent and providing the surface upon which images can be projected.  The image sequencing is preprogrammed for the twelve months of the year to begin operation at dusk and continue through midnight.",

        "description": "Lineage is composed of three sculptural elements creating a connective line that joins Fire Station 35 with the Southside Community Center: Water and light activate the Strata Wall, Tule Reed Drain, and Community Beacons. The art connects the viewer with the community’s history from past to future through forms, artifacts, and imagery. From early stories celebrating the healing power of local springs, to the sustenance of the community through agriculture, and as a key element in the service of fire fighters, water is the essential component to life in the valley. Water flows from the Tule Reed Drain into a runnel on top of the Strata Wall, and then cascades onto a splash stone and into the landscape. Like water, light sustains the community from plant growth to the flow of electric energy essential to high tech. Sunlight reveals the rich colors of the art and brings the solar-powered Community Beacons to life at night, while electric light illuminates layers in the Strata Wall.",

        "description": "The design of this commemorative artwork connects San Jose State University with Plaza de Cesar Chavez, in the heart of the City's downtown.  The artwork references Dr. Ernesto Galarza’s life-long pursuit of bridging academic and civil life and referencing the many facets of his work, including academia, poetry, education and labor organizing.  The work is composed of three elements:\r\n\r\nLibrary Table:\r\nThe surface of the cast-concrete library table is inlaid with bronze farm tools, a cast-bronze field-worker's hat, photo-etched black granite portraits, photo-etched ceramic tiles and bronze text.  The relief surface of the table is designed to encourage pedestrians to view and touch the inlaid elements.\r\n\r\nCast Bronze Chair\r\nAt the west end of the table, facing Plaza de Cesar Chavez, an empty cast-bronze chair with a wooden seat serves as a metaphor for Dr. Galarza as the field worker who took his scholarly practice into the world.  The chair is a functional element, and is intended to encourage visitors to stop, sit and explore the information contained in the table surface.\r\n\r\nRibbons of Terrazzo\r\nThe ribbons of terrazzo are 11\" wide and of varying length, and lace through the existing Paseo paving in each of the four blocks.  Designed to have a subtle physical and visual impact upon the Paseo, these ribbons are intended to draw the pedestrian through the length of the walkway.  The terrazzo is inlaid with bronze text, in both English and Spanish, introducing the commemoration through personal recollections about Dr. Galarza's life and work from his family, friends and colleagues.",

        "description": "Meditation Bench is a sculptural chair that is placed on a hill overlooking the park. From afar, the bench appears to be a sculpture, but upon further exploration, one discovers that it is also a private bench to contemplate the view. The inspiration for the form of the bench is drawn from nature, such as a seed pod or leaf. The spiral designs represents a spirit of renewal and the cycle of life. Thus,  Meditation Bench is intended to connect the sitter to the environment of Groesbeck Hill Park, and the beauty of the natural forms found in nature. This piece reflects the artist’s study of archetypal symbols from nature and ancient art. She considers shapes such the sprial, circle, and cresent a part of a universal visual language. Inspiration for these geometric forms also comes from ancient pottery and cave walls, which the artist has explored extensively. For the artist, Meditation Bench is both a reference to nature and to past artistic forms.",

        "description": "All over the world, trees have figured in ancient myths, and rituals, and many trees of legend are also a source of knowledge. The artist inspired by this and further intrigued by the transformation of butterflies, and that as a metaphor for the human life process from childhood to maturity. With these ideas in mind Ms. Liew created Trees of Knowledge: two \"trees\" formed by integrating painted elements, positioned to suggest treetops, onto columns of the building. Their shape also echoes that of butterfly wings and each is painted with rich, colorful mythological imagery. Ms. Liew suggests that these, \"serve as a gateway to the world of imagination and learning that await the visitors to the Children's section of the library.\"   Ms. Liew's Metamorphosis - Transformation in the Woods is a painting in the form of butterfly wings. Located in the Storytelling Corner, these are positioned so as to frame the storyteller. Colorful imagery on the wings references characters from classic fairytales, nursery rhymes set in the forest, and folklore and is intended to inspire positive themes for young readers.",

Alphabet Windows: twenty six of the small classroom windows feature an animal or a bird whose name corresponds with one of the letters of the alphabet.Animal Footprints: Animal foot prints are impressed into the plaza around the water fountain near the Administrative building.  They are placed in such a way as to appear that the animals have come to drink at the \"watering hole.\"Fossil Wall: The wall between the Kindergarten and Multi-use room, presents a geological fossil, a replica of actual an actual fossil.  Students are exposed to the concept of geological time and the fossil record.Classroom Name Plaques: Each of the three floors of the school building are given a classification category of Animal, Vegetable or Mineral.  The ground floor is named for rocks and minerals, the second floor for plant life and the third floor for animal life. Each room is given a name as a layer of identity beyond the usual room numbers. The progression upward in the building represents greater complexity of life.   Banner Mural: Historic murals from the original school have been documented and photographically reproduced on screen mesh fabric, which is hung as 2' X 5' banners in the mulit-use room. The project seeks to celebrate the identity of the school by preserving the past and contributing new identity to inspire the imagination of its student body.",

        "description": "Internationally-recognized photographer Catherine Wagner created a dynamic architectural frieze that investigates ideas about knowledge, nature, wonder and discovery. This frieze is installed on the clerestory walls of the library entrance, and consists of printed images laminated to aluminum panels. Source material for the photos includes trees, rocks and plants from Overfelt Gardens, as well as Chinese Scholars’ Rocks from some of the preeminent collections in the United States.Integrated into the installation at the west end of the building is the signage for the Library’s “Tech Connect” area. This sign is comprised of two parts—the practical wayfinding text, and the surrounding cellular image forms. The cellular pattern was made using Voronoi diagrams for points that are algorithmically distributed through the panel and concentrated within the letter forms. So, abstractly the cells are defined by the letters and the surrounding images themselves. The “Tech Connect” sign was designed by Michael Thompson of Coded Meaning, a frequent collaborator with Ms. Wagner.",

        "description": "The title of this work came from the community's aspirations for each child in Edenvale to find success in life. The artwork consists of two elements: bronze sculptures inset into the exterior walls at each of the three entrances to the building, and vinyl drawings on the large gymnasium windows that face Branham. All the elements are based on objects, images and ideas cultivated by the artists from the community. The artists engaged in extensive interaction with the Edenvale community in the creation of the artwork. They went out to schools, neighborhood and community gatherings, youth centers and the library to encourage community members to \"Be a Part of the Art\" by contributing objects, stories, photos and memorabilia that represented their own lives.   The window drawings depict a series of doors, many photographed in the adjacent neighborhood. The doors become an entry point to different ideas the artists wanted to convey, based on the community outreach and their own research.   Sculptures are set in boxes that are inset in the façade of the building. The sculptures are hybrids of many of the donated and discovered items from a very diverse community brought together in a way to inspire new thinking about everyday objects, as well as the long and interesting history of the area. The bronzes are accompanied by quotes from A Spiritual Thought for Each Day, a book of inspirational thoughts by Mary Hayes- Chynoweth, an early settler in the Edenvale, and builder of Hayes Mansion.",

The artwork references text, language, and writing – the tools which poets and playwrights have used throughout history. It is a metaphor for the technology of the written word and for the flight of imagination.  \r\n\r\nThe artwork is composed of two main elements: a 24-foot illuminated quill and a circular element which supports a perforated steel screen with cut-out text. Both the quill and the circle are supported by a 16-foot tapered mast. The quill is mounted on bearings allowing it to rotate in the wind. The structure of both elements is composed of stainless steel tubing. \r\n\r\nThe artwork also features text from William Shakespeare’s The Tempest, and reads “We are such stuff as dreams are made on...” This piece celebrates language as a triumph of human ingenuity. As Douglas Hollis said, “Birds fly in air, fish swim in water and humans live in language.”",

        "description": "The artwork is comprised of two parts: Aton and Floribunda. Aton by definition is the disk of the sun, regarded as a deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. A 5’ diameter aluminum disc frames glass roses that shoot out from the surface like solar flares. Each rose is attached to a pipe stem threaded through hieroglyphic punctures cut in the surface of the disc. The stems continue through the disc and braid into a 12 foot long ‘stream’ trailing through the lobby space. Roses, leaves and thorns adorn this ‘stem stream’. The inspiration for Aton is from two sources and the meanings prompted by their overlay are multifaceted. Framed by the disc, the rose may represent passion & friendship (red & yellow), solar flares (blossoms framed by the disc), streams of thought (intertwined stems), problems & challenges (thorns), and, perhaps, as the mystic poet Rumi might ascribe—an inner luminosity essential to the rose itself. The second piece of Olé is Floribunda (a popular rose cultivar group) located on fireplace chimney. This element is a metal piece with water jet cut hieroglyphics mounted on the chimney with a stream of glass roses randomly placed from mantle to ceiling. The blown glass and aluminum artwork explores the natural world in the context of the world of knowledge and reason – historic and contemporary.",

        "description": "Cory Kamehanaokala Taum has been a life-long student and avid participant in the Oceanic art movement, in both traditional and contemporary forms ranging from large-scale public murals to traditional Hawaiian tattooing and carving. In his youth, he made a name for himself creating graffiti that echoed the ancient styles and philosophies of his mother land Hawai’i. Since then, he has been able to delve deeper into the forms of his ancestors and hopes to present them to the world thru his surreal and iconic paintings that reflect both the tales of his ancestors, juxtaposed with his experience being born raised in the concrete jungle of Honolulu. 'One Ocean, One People': A celebration of Oceanic peoples and our great legacy of voyaging around the earth. Inspired by the idea that the ocean is something that unites us, not seperate us. 'There are no more suitable people on earth to be guardians of the worldʻs largest ocean than those for whom it has been home for generations'- Epeli Hauʻofa. The composition of patterns and manaʻo were shared with me thru our teacher, Suluʻape Keone Nunes, and reference different aspects of Hawaiian spirituallity in regards to navigation and voyaging. The 'above the clouds' scene represents the view for the migratory sea birds and the idea that as human beings we must strive for the zenith in every choice and action.",

        "description": "Origin is a sculptural installation located  in the museum’s lower level south atrium. The artwork explores the relationship between art and technology, and celebrates the earth’s basic natural resources as the foundation of technological innovation. \r\n\r\nOrigin is comprised of several integral elements. A gilded, nine-foot diameter tower rises 45’ from the lower level’s terrazzo floor. The terrazzo floor design, which can easily be seen from the upper levels and the staircase as one descends, is derived from the pattern of an early integrated circuit. Natural granite boulders placed within the floor space provide informal seating. Upon further exploration the viewer looks up to a suspended tree-root system covered in gold leaf. An elegant spectrum of ever unfolding colored lights play across the interior surfaces of the tower and interact\r\nwith the suspended gilded root system. This play of light patterns is\r\nthe result of a solar light sculpture at the roof level which gathers\r\nsunlight and projects it through a series of mirrors to an imaging\r\nmechanism inside the tower.",

The 1800 foot path is embossed with black walnut and apricrot leaves, thus making the emphemereal process of leaves falling permanent. The embossed leaves also have a fossil-like design nostalgic of the fruit orchards that used to inhabit the site.  Community participation was an integral part of the design of this project. Members of the neighborhood around Cataldi Park were invited to emboss the leaves into the cement over a two day period. In doing so, this project hoped to encourage a greater sense of community, a sentiment of shared property, and a feeling of involvement in the process.",

The design is presented  as  if  the  parts could be snapped out of their frame and reassembled.  Small  portraits, reflective of faces found in the community, are embedded within the artwork. The artwork is intended to serve as a colorful “bridge” between the Library’s entrance and the Children’s area.  Potential  also suggests a metaphor for the process  of  transformation.  It  demonstrates how, in the creation of a low rider bicycle, an old junk  bicycle frame is modified,restored and transformed into something new and beautiful.",

        "description": "Born in Spain, German in heritage, and residing in New York since 1999, the identical twin brothers How and Nosm (Raoul and Davide Perre) are best known internationally for their large-scale murals that adorn city walls. The twins first encountered graffiti art as young teenagers making aerosol paramount in all their public works. Utilizing limiting palettes and complex compositions make their work visually mesmerizing. As you peel back one layer, another story reveals itself further complicating the message and meaning. Ongoing themes of alcoholism, betrayal, and abuse of power intertwine with positive elements as though a mirror is being held up to society; a dizzying effect that requires patience and time to unwind. 'Qualities of Life': Our latest mural focuses on the general well-being of individuals and societies, outlining negative and positive features of life. It reflects on life satisfaction, including everything from physical health, family, education, employment, wealth, safety, security to freedom, religious beliefs, and the environment. Quality of life should not be confused with the concept of standard of living, which is based primarily on income.",

The infrastructure accommodates projection based, digital and data-driven artworks, and can be changed over time in keeping with the inevitable technological changes of the future.",

        "description": "The San José Public Art Program in association with Adobe Systems, commissioned artist Ben Rubin in the creation of artwork for Adobe's Amaden Tower.  Not unlike the Semaphore Telegraphs of the 18th century,each wheel of the San José Semaphore can assume four distinct positions and together, the four wheels have a vocabulary of 256 possible combinations that turn into new positions every 7.2 seconds pulsing out a coded message, the content of which is a mystery left as a challenge for the viewers to decipher. As of October 2012, a new code is being displayed; cracking the encryption technique and deciphering the message is posed as a challenge for the public. To the first person or group to successfully crack the new code, Adobe will award bragging rights and acknowledgment on both the Adobe website and the San José Semaphore website.Adobe's Almaden Tower is situated directly beneath the flight path for aircraft landing at the Mineta San José International Airport, and the San José Semaphore is sensitive to the passage of aircraft above it. When a plane flies overhead, the wheels react visibly to the disturbance, and its steady rhythm is broken. After the plane has passed, the disks resume their steady, purposeful transmission. San José Semaphore functions as a beacon in the San José skyline. It is a large and beautiful machine for communication, a slow-motion magnifier for digital communications. Unlike digital transmissions that pass invisibly through the air and through microscopic circuitry, the San José Semaphore’s communication efforts are visible for all to see.",

These provide children with perfect places to curl up and read a book.  The third element, The Tree, recalls a magical tree in a fairy tale. Composed of a collection of suspended colorful everyday objects, the sculpture is interwoven with sparkling lights and creates a canopy over the children’s reading area.",

        "description": "Sensing YOU and Sensing WATER are two artworks geographically and conceptually linked but distinctly\r\ndifferent. The projects are part of the “Illuminating Downtown Project (IDP).” The intent of IDP is to visually reinforce downtown\r\nSan Jose as the Capital of Silicon Valley, and that this energy would be transmitted at a number of scales\r\n– building tops, gateways, on the street and as one passes through the downtown. It is a way to engage art,\r\nlight and technology in a larger vision of the downtown, while considering ways of making the downtown\r\na more livable, enjoyable, engaging place.\r\nSensing YOU is an interactive artwork defined by over 1000 painted circles and 81 individually controlled illuminated rings that play a variety of patterns and low-resolution mapped video over the ceiling surface of the I-87 highway underpass at Santa Clara Street. The patterns are activated by pedestrians and bicyclists moving through the space- setting off pre-programmed sequences.Sensing WATER, a weather-responding and interactive artwork utilizing light and paint to define the downtown gateway at Highway 87 and San Fernando St. The project is composed of 2 elements, the massive painted sloped wall that abstractly references flowing water, and the overhead evening lighting that illuminates with rippling patterns of light the underpass. The project uses real-time NOAA weather data to compose different patterns of light on the ceiling. (e.g.: 0-5mph winds vs thunderstorms)",

        "description": "Shapeshifters 1, 2 & 3 are a trio of hand-painted murals on the 2nd floor. The rich colors, lines and forms in these murals flow up the stairway and wrap around corners, providing interplay with the architectural lines and fields of light.   Spiritual Stonehenge is a vinyl mural on the ground floor that creates a vibrant field of color as it wraps around the Center’s juice bar, extending into the community room. Mural work is included on the juice bar’s sliding door so that the mural’s appearance changes depending on the position of that door. Spiritual Stonehenge continues to the outside of the building on the north entrance, providing colorful backdrop to Jackie Brookner’s exterior public art. Martinez’s untitled chromed and painted steel sculpture is in the 2nd floor art room. The artist intends for the imagery in the artwork to suggest elements of the history of the park, the area, and the street culture of the area’s youth so that it might function as a new type of urban folk art.",

The frieze is decorated with cutouts of cats and dogs emphasizing their curious and jovial natures. At night the frieze it lit from behind, highlighting the cutouts. Two sentinel statues of a dog and a cat stand on either side of the entrance; heraldic figures guarding the center. These free standing engravings of granite and steel are placed upon models of the animal care center accentuating the purpose of the center as an animal care facility.  The “Gallery of Myths” is a series of eight granite tablets along the portico of the building, which describe stories, myths, or aphorisms about cats and dogs connecting humanity with the mythos of pets.",

        "description": "Soaring Flight commemorates flight pioneer John J. Montgomery. The artwork consists of two elements: a vertical 30’ sculptural representation of a glider wing formed of tubular steel and covered in steel mesh, and the colored concrete plaza textured with linear patterns that flow around the wing element in an airflow pattern similar to that around an ascending plane wing. Soaring Flight is positioned with Montgomery Hill as a backdrop, the site of many of his pioneering flights. \r\n\r\nPhrases and quotes associated with Montgomery’s work are sandblasted into the plaza; benches are placed around the perimeter of the plaza. Together these elements create, in Roberts’ words, “A haven where visitors may learn about local history and Montgomery specifically, as well as reflect upon human invention...a subject so significantly linked to San Jose.\"",

        "description": "This work includes four art glass windows located in the children's area and a suspended glass lamp near the library entrance.The artwork's visual imagery refers to ancient alphabets as the foundation of the written word, which in turn is fundamental to libraries and illumination of the mind. Each pane contains characters in different scripts that are the basis for written Latin, Russian, Vietnamese and some Indian languages. These are lineages of the languages that presently are predominant in the Pearl Avenue Branch Library collection. The lamp is inscribed with ancient Sumerian cuneiform script which repeats the text \"We are all one.\"  The lamp is lit with color changing LEDs, programmed to cycle on 30-minute intervals through the color spectrum. In this way the lamp also functions as a timepiece. Another critical but unseen aspect to the artwork are photovoltaic cells that are embedded in the four glass panes. These collect solar energy that then provides power to light the lamp. Through this work the artist is seeking to awaken people to the miracle of language and writing as the key to understanding the past, expressing the present and imagining the future. The artist also wants to raise awareness of the real possibilities of harnessing available energy to provide for basic needs.",

        "description": "South Fished Street features 36 bronze and stainless steel elements depicting fish embedded in the concrete sidewalk. 13 students from the Art in Community class under the direction of Professor Tony May were responsible for design, fabrication, and installation of the public art. The design for the installation was developed through discussion among Art in Community class members who were inspired by a visit to the koi pond in the Japanese Friendship Garden in San Jose’s Kelley Park. The design uses the park sidewalk as a “meandering stream” populated by a variety of fish. The fish represent the diversity of individuals from many cultures that live in the Martha Gardens neighborhood. The fish are also a playful reference to elaborate water features and ornamental fishponds.",

        "description": "Teaching Stones is a tribute to Doris Dillon, a beloved teacher and community member. Doris Dillon was known for her generous spirit and passion for teaching.  She engaged students through games, and it was often said that she could “teach a rock to read.”  Teaching Stones consists of two primary elements.

In the same spirit in which Doris fostered learning through play, the stones can serve as a playful learning tool for future generations: rubbings can be done on the stones with pencil and paper, with students moving from stone to stone, gathering a noun from one, a verb from another and onward until a full sentence is collected.This commemorative artwork honors Doris Dillon’s legacy of mixing learning with pleasure in the form of a gift to the community she loved so well.",

        "description": "Teaching Stones is a tribute to Doris Dillon, a beloved teacher and community member. Doris Dillon was known for her generous spirit and passion for teaching.  She engaged students through games, and it was often said that she could “teach a rock to read.”  Teaching Stones consists of two primary elements. The first is a reading/sitting area, inspired by one of Doris’ favorite activities: story telling. The reading area provides a place to sit and share stories in the traditional manner of gathering in a circle.

On each of its four sides are figurative images that depict a man, woman, elderly woman and child carved in negative relief.  The sculpture is gently animated by a sound element created by the interplay between recorded voices and electronic data related to the library. A data stream, such as the traffic of people in and out of the library throughout the day, the library’s collection, or circulation of library materials, will utilize specially-designed software to interface with vocal tones to create unique musical patterns, generating a “sound portrait” of the library. The sound of this will softly emanate from the granite sculpture, audible when one is nearby.",

The second “cloud” is created from hundreds of cast aluminum apricots and doll-sized human figures that form a topography evocative of the hills surrounding the city. The juxtaposition of agricultural and technological references addresses the ambiguity of an agricultural past and technological future.",

Influenced by various 90’s graffiti art expressed in Europe and New York, 123KLAN crafted a hybrid style that mixes graffiti art and graphic design, and gives rise to a new synthesis forming their motto, “When street knowledge meets technology, and graffiti art melts wit graphic design.” Their first works were enriched by huge, sharped- angled letters in acid colors and characters with futuristic manga features posed alongside experimental types. Far from confining themselves to urban walls with the aerosol, the vector allows them to land on multiple media, like record sleeves, posters, stickers, toy designs, posters, skateboards, canvas, shoes, and t-shirts.",

        "description": "Co-owning and operating The Arsenal with her husband, artist Sean Boyles, Roan Victor is utterly dedicated to her art. Sublime, ethereal paintings in oil, and lately watercolor, her work expresses—often through flowers, linens, and obscured faces—the camouflage or privacy we all seek in an increasingly changing world. “I’m a painter. I work in watercolor, oil and latex paint. Watercolors keep me in order and oil painting is a party. When I paint walls, encountering various scales, proportions and settings excite me. I revel in the different ways I can present a figure in such a large format.” Sean mostly draws and paints. His day job is teaching others to do the same whether at Mission College, CSU Monterey Bay or at The Arsenal, which Sean opened with his wife Roan Victor in 2011. The aesthetic of Sean’s work comes from watching cartoons, playing video games, painting graffiti, collecting garbage pail kids, reading comic books, watching Star Wars, kung fu, ninja, sci-fi, and giant monster movies. Sean creates his work between his heart and head; between what he knows and what he feels. Sean tries to be both detailed and gestural, clean and messy, smooth and gritty, fluid and structured, soft subtleties with loud splattery edges.",

Their work appears on walls and galleries throughout China, Germany, Iran, Norway, the United States and globally. They transcend their histories of artistic and political censorship by using public art to envision a world freed from borders, war, and violence.

        "description": "Anna Valentina Murch’s Garden Park is situated in Edenvale Park next to the historic Hayes Mansion. Through public meetings, Murch discovered that the community wanted an artwork that was inspired by the vast history of the site. They asked for the piece to incorporate elements of the indigenous people of the valley, the agricultural era, Frontier Village - the 1960s era amusement park located on the site, the Hayes family orchards, and the garden of Mary Hayes. They also desired an artwork that revolved around a theme of transition, both physically and symbolically, to represent the transformation of the park through the master plan and the restoration of wildlife. Lastly, they hoped that Murch’s artwork would be a place of contemplation and peace. Murch’s artwork features a stone circle in the middle of the garden covered in round holes, reminiscent of Native American pounding holes, which function as waterholes for wildlife. To the north of the stone circle is an oak grove, which also references indigenous people who were dependent upon acorns as a staple of their diet. Ornamental cherry trees are planted to the west and east of the circle in remembrance of the Hayes’s orchard and the valley’s agricultural past. A bridge leads away from the circle towards the mansion over a moat of wildflowers in honor of Frontier Village. Lavender is found on the far edge of the oak grove, creating a rich scent nostalgic of Mary Hayes’ healing garden. This peaceful artwork provides an area for quiet meditation on the transition of the seasons and the transformation of the park’s historic value. Students from neighboring elementary, middle and high schools participated in the creation of the artwork and, in the past, used it as a touchstone for a curriculum about the community.",

Metal work is continued in each of the gates into the plaza.  Mosaic thresholds inside the gates explore the theme of location and direction. The thresholds were inspired by mosaics commonly seen in Mexican colonial cities such as Taxco, Puebla and Tlaxcala and mosaic work in San Jose.    The garden alcoves are offering places linked by thematic press tiles to the cardinal directions and dedicated to a community value. The tiles were created by community members during a series of public workshops. The photographic tiles were translated from family albums and personal collections contributed by the local community.    A recurring image of the hummingbird, derived from Mesoamerican motifs, can be seen at the water fountain and on two accent walls at the south and east entrances. The hummingbird, an ancient Mesoamerican talisman, is a symbol of love and the warrior spirit. It is common in San Jose, a tiny but tenacious bird that migrates thousands of miles from Mexico to California every year and plays a role in shaping the landscape by pollinating the plants from which it drinks nectar. The hummingbird motif is intended to speak to the spirit of immigrant citizens, their endurance, strength, tenacity, and their contributions to the culture and nature of California.

Working fast, in classic graffiti “throw up” style, Dragon76 paints with acrylic and marker pen as well as using stenciling techniques. His art is described by many as passionate and energetic and the concept of his art style is the co-existence of two opposites such as the past and future, stillness and motion, evil and justice. Be it music, dance, bathing in sunshine or marching against injustice, his talent lies in capturing an energy that conveys action, Dragon76 creates stunning works that feel as well as look wonderful. Dragon76 also performs improvised and dynamic live painting shows around the world, which always attracts large audiences. Dragon76 lives and works in New York, where his art and style continue to progress. He is a two-time winner of the 2017 New York Art Battle. Woes was born on the Hawaiian Island of Oahu, but spent most of his childhood growing up and moving from Southern California to Nevada before finally landing back into Hawaii during his Junior year in high school. In 1998 a car accident changed everything; this life-threatening experience inspired him to leave the island once again, this time to Seattle, Washington. Inspired by the people, rain and being indoors, he started playing around with different art mediums again. Woes then left back to Hawaii with a new perspective. Having roots in graffiti, Woes started rocking his iconic Panda characters to leave a mark in different cities, countries around the world and became addicted leaving his character of a species in jeopardy.

        "description": "Nikkea Takagi, a biracial Japanese artist, raised in San Jose, explores the process of personal healing within her brightly colored paintings. Most of her work depicts familiar characters submerged in their own tiny eco-systems, surrounded by teapots, plants, and lanterns. Nikkea’s work is deeply rooted in the process of self-discovery and healing. To Nikkea, art is a practice of self-care and is deeply personal. “My art is constantly changing and evolving, as am I. This work does not exclusively represent me, but it is a reflection of my ever-expanding experience.” Nikkea values that we all relate to imagery uniquely according to our individual narratives. Through the use of playful colors, body-positivity, and small tokens of comfort, she hopes to invoke a sense of empowerment and empathy to all of those who view her work. Nikkea Takagi is a budding artist in the Bay Area. Her goal is to more vulnerable present her own experiences as a personal act of energy clearing and as an offering to anyone in need of some compassion or connection.",

        "description": "Voxel Cloud is visible to thousands of commuters, residents and visitors driving on Interstate 280, as well as aircraft utilizing Mineta San José International Airport.  Draping across the roof line of The Pierce, a residential apartment building in Downtown San Jose, Voxel Cloud serves as a gateway marker for San José’s SoFA Art District, The dynamic, illuminated, data-driven LED sculpture takes its visual cues from natural forms as varied as water particles, interstellar star systems, the crystalline aggregates of silicon carbide, and the multi-chromatic raw materials of semiconductor wafers. Voxel Cloud was made possible through a partnership between the project owner/developer, Sares Regis Group of Northern California, Pritzker Realty Group, and the City of San José Public Art Program. It was supported in part by an ArtPlace grant (www.artplaceamerica.org). It is the fifth of six Illuminating Downtown Project (IDP) grants awarded for creative placemaking projects in San José, bringing artists and arts organizations together to enrich the city and its communities. IDP combines art and technology to physically manifest San José’s aspiration for creating a more engaging downtown—whether someone is approaching from the surrounding freeways or walking its streets.",

The fields slope from Santa Clara Street toward the City Hall plaza allowing the water to flow down the surface of the fields onto the plaza in subtle ripples. Water also flows over the vertical stone on the fountain edges, disappearing beneath the plaza, creating walls of water that define the perimeter along Santa Clara Street. The water within the field is programmed to respond to changes in time of day, temperature, season and availability of water to create different visual, sonic and atmospheric qualities. The piece is illuminated at night for a distinctive evening identity.",

        "description": "Mr. Nagase describes his concept of a tree as metaphor for the body and soul of the earliest inhabitants. Trees encompass an iconic role in community life. Throughout time trees have served as gathering places, and learning takes place beneath their branches. Such trees become part of a community’s sense of self and even when they disappear, they remain in the community’s collective sense of place. These ideas inspired this 6’ diameter granite seating element. Handprints on the side of the tree were collected from local community members and children at the Grant Elementary School, and in the center is an abbreviated history of the site – echoing the role rings play in marking the age of a tree. Incised in the ground are “shadows” of branches overhead.",

        "description": "The 12 sculptures reflect the wildlife of the river. One of the repeated elements in the series, the dragonfly, is considered to be one of the most ancient species that survived from the Jurassic period. The dragonfly references the element of water, as well as the health of the river and its ecological systems. The sculptural insects are of various sizes, heights and locations attached to posts on ball bearings that allow the sculptures to move with the wind. Sunlight creates additional interest by casting shadows through the laser cut wings and reflections off the colorful glass eyes.  The sculptures are intended to reawaken the relationship to the wind, sun, and water, fundamental elements of nature in this urban park. The sculptures also celebrate the Guadalupe River that gives life to flora and fauna and people of San Jose.",

Ruth's windows are intended to capture the feeling of light as it filters through tree branches, particularly through willow tree branches. The windows are a striking feature viewed from either the interior or exterior. During the afternoon they create colorful patterns reminiscent of light through leaves on the inside of the library; while in the evening, light from the library emanates outward through the windows.",
